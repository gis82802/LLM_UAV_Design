# **Product description**

The UBX-A9940-KA positioning chip features the u-blox ninth generation GNSS receiver platform and the first generation ASIL-B graded HW, targeting ADAS L2+, L3 and above applications for the Autonomous driving market.

The UBX-A9940-KA receiver can concurrently support three constellations (GPS, GALILEO, and Beidou) in the dual-band configuration (L1/L2 bands or L1/L5 bands).

The A9 platform was designed to meet the stringent functional safety standards and high-integrity requirements typically required by ADAS applications such as lane-accurate positioning and geo-fencing.

u-blox meticulously developed both the A9 hardware and the corresponding firmware according to the ISO26262-2018 functional safety standard, thereby offering peace of mind to the customer in meeting the latest autonomous driving safety regulations and standards.

The A9 Safe Measurement Engine (SME) provides the safe GNSS RAW data (pseudorange and carrier phase information in the Safe UBX format) as an input to the Safe Position Engine (SPE). The SPE then combines other critical components like IMU, WSS (wheel speed sensor), and Safe Correction Services (SCS) to provide dm-level positioning accuracy. The SME plays a critical role in achieving a very high level of integrity for the overall position solution (for example, 10e-6/hour; in other words, 1 failure in 1000000 hours, which is approximately once in 114 years!).
