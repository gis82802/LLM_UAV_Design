#### **5 Customer impact and recommended action**

• Customers ordering NEO-M8P-0 and NEO-M8P-2 will receive latest or prior version of the modules, depending on availability.

<span id="page-0-0"></span><sup>1</sup> The estimated first shipment date is the forecasted date when a customer may expect to receive the changed product with the new type number. This is determined by the estimated date of inventory depletion on the PCN issue date. This may be affected by fluctuations in supply and demand. Consequently, although customers should be prepared to receive the changed product on this date, u-blox will continue to ship the pre-changed product until the inventory has been depleted. This may result in the pre-changed product being shipped to customers after this forecasted date.



- Since the new firmware flash FW 3.05 HPG 1.43 is backward-compatible and has the same functionality as flash FW 3.01 HPG 1.40, and offers functional improvements, upgrade to the latest firmware version is possible for customers of any NEO-M8P-0 and/or NEO-M8P-2. Please, note the default configuration changes [1].
- The new firmware flash FW 3.05 HPG 1.43 will be available for download from u-blox website at the time of first availability of the latest NEO-M8P-0 and NEO-M8P-2 (see table above).
