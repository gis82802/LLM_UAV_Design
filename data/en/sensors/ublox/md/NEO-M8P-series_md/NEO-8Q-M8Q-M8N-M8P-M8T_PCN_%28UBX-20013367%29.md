### **3 Description of change**

Due to the End of Life announcement of one MLCC capacitor, u-blox is introducing minor PCB redesign for the u-blox NEO modules listed in section [1.](#page-0-0) To improve the resilience of our supply chain, u-blox takes this opportunity to also introduce alternative TCXO.

The product specifications, overall performance and characteristics of the product remain unchanged.

# **5 Customer impact and recommended action**

The new versions of the affected products are electrically and functionally identical with the pre-changed products. There will be no technical impact as a result of this change. All changed products are qualified and conformant with the current specifications.

If customers want to evaluate the new module, they can use the sample order program to request parts for their own qualification and reliability tests.

All customers are recommended to migrate to the new versions as they become available. Prechanged versions will not be available after some time when inventory has been depleted.

We thank you for your understanding and assure you our very best support.

<span id="page-1-0"></span> <sup>1</sup> The estimated first shipment date is the forecasted date when a customer may expect to receive the changed product with the new type number. This is determined by the estimated date of inventory depletion on the PCN issue date. This may be affected by fluctuations in supply and demand. Consequently, although customers should be prepared to receive the changed product on this date, u-blox will continue to ship the pre-changed product until a time in which inventory has been depleted. This may result in the pre-changed product being shipped to customers after this forecasted date.
