# **Preface**

## <span id="page-15-1"></span>**1 Document Overview**

The interface description including receiver description is an important resource for integrating and configuring u-blox receivers. This document has a modular structure and it is not necessary to read it from the beginning to the end. There are two main sections: The Receiver Description and the Interface Description.

The Receiver Description describes the software aspects of system features and configuration of u-blox receivers. The Receiver Description is structured according to areas of functionality, with links provided to the corresponding NMEA and UBX messages, which are described in the Interface Description.

The Interface Description is a reference describing the messages used by the u-blox receiver and is organized by the specific NMEA, UBX, and RTCM messages.

## This document provides general information on u-blox receivers. Some information might not apply to certain products. Refer to the product data sheet and/or integration manual for possible restrictions or limitations.

## <span id="page-15-2"></span>**2 Firmware and Protocol Versions**

The protocol version defines a set of messages that are applicable across various u-blox products. Each firmware used by a u-blox receiver supports a specific protocol version, which is not configurable.

The following sections will explain how to decode the shown information to get the firmware and the protocol version.

## <span id="page-15-3"></span>**2.1 How to Determine the Version and the Location of the Firmware**

The u-blox receiver contains a firmware in two different locations:

- Internal ROM
- External flash memory

The location and the version of the currently running firmware can be found in the boot screen or in the UBX-MON-VER message.

For firmware supporting [Protocol Version 17 and below:](#page-21-1)

- [Boot screen, Protocol Version 17 and below](#page-15-4)
- [UBX-MON-VER, Protocol Version 17 and below](#page-18-0)

For firmware supporting [Protocol Version from 18 to 23.01:](#page-21-1)

- [Boot screen, Protocol Version from 18 to 23.01](#page-17-0)
- [UBX-MON-VER, Protocol Version 18 to 23.01](#page-20-0)

## <span id="page-21-0"></span>**2.2 How to Determine the Supported Protocol Version of the u-blox Receiver**

Each u-blox receiver reports its supported protocol version in the following ways:

- On start-up in the [boot screen](#page-17-0)
- In the [UBX-MON-VER message](#page-20-0)

with the line containing PROTVER (example: PROTVER=18.00).

Additionally, the firmware string, together with the firmware version, can be used to look up the corresponding protocol version. The tables below give an overview of the released firmware and their corresponding protocol versions.

# **Receiver Description**

## <span id="page-23-1"></span>**3 Receiver Configuration**

## <span id="page-23-2"></span>**3.1 Configuration Concept**

u-blox receivers are fully configurable with UBX protocol configuration messages (message class UBX-CFG). The configuration used by the u-blox receiver during normal operation is called "Current Configuration". The Current Configuration can be changed during normal operation by sending any UBX-CFG-XXX message to the u-blox receiver over an I/O port. The u-blox receiver will change its Current Configuration immediately after receiving the configuration message. The ublox receiver always uses only the Current Configuration.

Unless the Current Configuration is made permanent by using [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) as described below, the Current Configuration will be lost when there is:

- a power cycle
- a hardware reset
- a (complete) controlled software reset

See the [section on resetting a u-blox receiver](#page-81-0) for details.

The Current Configuration can be made permanent (stored in a non-volatile memory) by saving it to the "Permanent Configuration". This is done by sending a [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) message with an appropriate **saveMask** (UBX-CFG-CFG/save).

The Permanent Configuration is copied to the Current Configuration during start-up or when a [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) message with an appropriate **loadMask** (UBX-CFG-CFG/load) is sent to the u-blox receiver.

The Permanent Configuration can be restored to the u-blox receiver's Default Configuration by sending a [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) message with an appropriate **clearMask** (UBX-CFG-CFG/clear) to the ublox receiver. This only replaces the Permanent Configuration, not the Current Configuration. To make the u-blox receiver operate with the Default Configuration which was restored to the Permanent Configuration, a UBX-CFG-CFG/load command must be sent or the u-blox receiver must be reset.

The mentioned masks (saveMask, loadMask, clearMask) are 4-byte bitfields. Every bit represents one configuration sub-section. These sub-sections are defined in section ["Organization of the](#page-24-0) [Configuration Sections".](#page-24-0) All three masks are part of every UBX-CFG-CFG message. Save, load and clear commands can be combined in the same message. Order of execution is: clear, save, load. The following diagram illustrates the process:





It is possible to change the current communications port settings using a [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) message. This could affect baud rate and other transmission parameters. Because there may be messages queued for transmission there may be uncertainty about which protocol applies to such messages. In addition a message currently in transmission may be corrupted by a protocol change. Host data reception parameters may have to be changed to be able to receive future messages, including the acknowledge message associated with the UBX-CFG-CFG message.

## <span id="page-24-0"></span>**3.2 Organization of the Configuration Sections**

The configuration is divided into several sub-sections. Each of these sub-sections corresponds to one or several UBX-CFG-XXX messages. The sub-section numbers in the following tables correspond to the bit position in the masks mentioned above. All values not listed are reserved.

## <span id="page-25-0"></span>**3.3 Permanent Configuration Storage Media**

The Current Configuration is stored in the volatile RAM of the u-blox receiver. Hence, any changes made to the Current Configuration without saving will be lost if any of the reset events listed in the section above occur. By using UBX-CFG-CFG/save, the selected configuration sub-sections are saved to all non-volatile memories available:

- On-chip BBR (battery backed RAM). In order for the BBR to work, a backup battery must be applied to the u-blox receiver.
- External flash memory, where available.

## <span id="page-25-1"></span>**3.4 u-blox Receiver Default Configuration**

The Permanent Configuration can be reset to Default Configuration through a [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1)/clear message. The Default Configuration of the u-blox receiver is normally determined when the u-blox receiver is manufactured. Refer to specific product data sheet for further details.

## <span id="page-25-2"></span>**3.5 Save-on-Shutdown Feature**

The save-on-shutdown feature (SOS) enables the u-blox receiver to store the contents of the battery-backed RAM to an external flash memory and restore it upon startup. This allows the ublox receiver to preserve some of the features available only with a battery backup (preserving configuration and satellite orbit knowledge) without having a battery backup supply present. It does not, however, preserve any kind of time knowledge. The save-on-shutdown must be commanded by the host. The restore-on-startup is automatically done if the corresponding data is present in the flash. No expiration check of the data is done.

The following outlines the suggested shutdown procedure when using the save-on-shutdown feature:

- With the [UBX-CFG-RST](#page-270-1) message, the host commands the u-blox receiver to stop, specifying reset mode 0x08 ("Controlled GNSS stop") and a BBR mask of 0 ("Hotstart").
- The u-blox receiver confirms the reception of a valid / invalid request with a [UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) / [UBX-](#page-193-0)[ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message.
- The host commands the saving of the contents of BBR to the flash memory using the [UBX-UPD-](#page-452-0)[SOS-BACKUP](#page-452-0) message.
- The u-blox receiver confirms the reception of a valid / invalid request with a [UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) / [UBX-](#page-193-0)[ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message.
- For a valid request the u-blox receiver reports on the success of the backup operation with a [UBX-](#page-453-0)[UPD-SOS-ACK](#page-453-0) message.
- The host powers off the u-blox receiver.
- Do not expect [UBX-CFG-RST](#page-270-1) and [UBX-UPD-SOS-BACKUP](#page-452-0) message to be acknowledged with a [UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) / [UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message by the receiver with newer FW versions.

And consequently the startup procedure is as follows:



- The host powers on the u-blox receiver.
- The u-blox receiver detects the previously stored data in flash. It restores the corresponding memory and reports the success of the operation with a [UBX-UPD-SOS-RESTORED](#page-454-0) message on the port where it had received the save command message (if the output protocol filter on that port allows it). It does not report anything if no stored data has been detected.
- Additionally the u-blox receiver outputs a [UBX-INF-NOTICE](#page-306-2) and/or a [NMEA-TXT](#page-173-1) message with the contents RESTORED in the boot screen (depends on port and information messages configuration) upon success.
- Optionally the host can deliver coarse time assistance using [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) for better startup performance.

Once the u-blox receiver has started up it is suggested to delete the stored data using a [UBX-UPD-](#page-453-0)[SOS-CLEAR](#page-453-0) message. The u-blox receiver responds with a [UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) or [UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message.

Note that this feature must not be used with [power save mode](#page-69-0) and that saved data must be deleted before switching to that mode.

## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**4 Concurrent GNSS**

Many u-blox positioning modules and chips are multi-GNSS receivers capable of receiving and processing signals from multiple Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS).

u-blox concurrent GNSS receivers are multi-GNSS receivers that can acquire and track satellites from more than one GNSS system at the same time, and utilize them in positioning.

## <span id="page-26-1"></span>**4.1 GNSS Types**

u-blox receivers support a wide range of different GNSS. Some GNSS have large numbers of satellites deployed globally and therefore are generally capable of providing navigation solutions on their own. u-blox designates these as "major GNSS". By contrast, some are designed to be used to enhance the use of one or more major GNSS and u-blox designates these "augmentation systems".

In many cases, such as [Satellite Numbering,](#page-460-1) this distinction does not matter as u-blox receivers generally try to combine information from all available GNSS to create the best possible navigation information. However, particularly in relation to [configuring the receiver,](#page-28-0) the distinction can be important.

## <span id="page-26-2"></span>**4.1.1 Major GNSS**

The major GNSS supported by u-blox receivers are described below.

## **4.1.1.1 GPS**

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a GNSS operated by the US department of defense. Its purpose is to provide position, velocity and time for civilian and defense users on a global basis. The system currently consists of 32 medium earth orbit satellites and several ground control stations.

## **4.1.1.2 GLONASS**

GLONASS is a GNSS operated by Russian Federation department of defense. Its purpose is to provide position, velocity and time for civilian and defense users on a global basis. The system consists of 24 medium earth orbit satellites and ground control stations.



It has a number of significant differences when compared to GPS. In most cases, u-blox receivers operate in a very similar manner when they are configured to use GLONASS signals instead of GPS. However some aspects of receiver output are likely to be noticeably affected.

## **4.1.1.3 Galileo**

At the time of writing (early 2018), the Galileo system was still under development with only a few fully operational SVs. Therefore, the precise performance and reliability of ublox receivers when receiving Galileo signals is effectively impossible to guarantee.

Galileo is a GNSS operated by the European Union. Its purpose is to provide position, velocity and time for civilian users on a global basis. The system is currently not fully operational. It is eventually expected to consist of 30 medium earth orbit satellites.

On u-blox M8 receivers a maximum of ten channels can be assigned to Galileo for signal acquisition and tracking. Note that at most eight Galileo satellites will be used for navigation. It is recommended not to set the number of Galileo channels higher than eight in [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1).

## **4.1.1.3.1 Search and Rescue Return Link Message**

The receiver supports reception and output of Search and Rescue (SAR) Return Link Messages (RLM). When enabled, a [UBX-RXM-RLM](#page-430-1) message will be generated whenever an RLM is detected by the receiver.

At the time of writing (early 2018), no live transmission of RLMs by Galileo SVs had been observed, so the details of their use was impossible to verify completely.

## **4.1.1.4 BeiDou**

BeiDou is a GNSS operated by China. Its purpose is to initially provide position, velocity and time for users in Asia. In a later stage when the system is fully deployed it will have worldwide coverage. The full system will consist of five geostationary, five inclined geosynchronous and 27 medium earth orbit satellites, as well as control, upload and monitoring stations. Although this implies a full constellation of 37 SVs, only SVs numbered 1 to 30 are fully supported in the D1/D2 NAV message described by the Interface Control Document version 2.0. For SVs numbered above 30, there is currently no almanac or differential correction. Consequently, u-blox receivers only use BeiDou SVs numbered 1 to 30.

## <span id="page-27-0"></span>**4.1.2 Augmentation Systems**

The augmentation systems supported by u-blox receivers are described below.

## **4.1.2.1 SBAS**

There are a number of Space Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) operated by different countries using geostationary satellites. u-blox receivers currently support the following:

- WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) operated by the US.
- EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) operated by the EU.
- MSAS (Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System) operated by Japan.
- GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation) operated by India.

See section [SBAS](#page-29-1) for more details.



## **4.1.2.2 QZSS**

The Quasi Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a regional satellite augmentation system operated by [Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency](http://www.jaxa.jp) (JAXA). It is intended as an enhancement to GPS, to increase availability and positional accuracy. The QZSS system achieves this by transmitting GPS-compatible signals in the GPS bands.

NMEA messages will show the QZSS satellites only if configured to do so (see section [Satellite](#page-460-1) [Numbering](#page-460-1)).

The QZSS L1SAIF is an additional signal broadcast by QZSS satellites that contains augmentation and other data.

## **4.1.2.3 IMES**

The Indoor MEssaging System (IMES) is an extension to the QZSS specification. See section [IMES](#page-34-1) for more details.

## <span id="page-28-0"></span>**4.2 Configuration**

The [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1) message allows the user to specify which GNSS signals should be processed along with limits on how many tracking channels should be allocated to each GNSS. The receiver will respond to such a request with a [UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) message if it can support the requested configuration or a [UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message if not.

Customers enabling BeiDou and/or Galileo who wish to use the NMEA protocol are recommended to select NMEA version 4.1, as earlier versions have no support for these two GNSS. See the [NMEA protocol section](#page-152-2) for details on selecting NMEA versions.

The combinations of systems which can be configured simultaneously depends on the receiver's capability to receive several carrier frequencies. The [UBX-MON-GNSS](#page-353-1) message reports which major GNSS can be selected. Refer to the data sheet of the corresponding u-blox receiver for full information. Usually GPS, SBAS (e.g. WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS), QZSS and Galileo can be enabled together, because they all use the 1575.42MHz L1 frequency. GLONASS and BeiDou both operate on different frequencies, therefore the receiver must be able to receive a second or even third carrier frequency in order to process these systems together with GPS.

It is recommended to disable GLONASS and BeiDou if a GPS-only antenna or GPS-only SAW filter is used.

In all circumstances, it is necessary for at least one [major GNSS](#page-26-2) to be enabled. It is also required that at least 4 tracking channels are available to each enabled major GNSS, i.e. maxTrkCh must have a minimum value of 4 for each enabled major GNSS. Further requirements on generating configurations acceptable by the receiver can be found in [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1).

## <span id="page-28-1"></span>**4.2.1 Switching between GNSS**

Users should be aware that switching between GNSS (and especially away from GPS) may affect the long term accuracy of the receiver until the next [cold start](#page-81-0). In normal operation the receiver selects the best models and corrections from the transmitted auxiliary data (e.g. UTC and Ionospheric parameters), basing this selection on the configured GNSS. Disabling a major GNSS prevents auxiliary data from that GNSS being refreshed and so it will become stale, resulting in progressively degraded performance. This can occur even if the main power supply is removed, as most receivers retain auxiliary data in non-volatile storage, e.g. battery backed RAM (BBR). For this reason, u-blox recommends that receivers are [cold started](#page-81-0) after any change that disables an



active GNSS, within a few weeks, but preferably immediately. This will ensure that the receiver then uses only regularly refreshed information from the newly configured constellations.

## <span id="page-29-0"></span>**4.2.2 Configuring QZSS L1SAIF**

By default the receiver will be configured for QZSS L1C/A, this can be changed so the receiver can be configured for QZSS L1SAIF also. See the table below for [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1) sigCfgMask settings for signals on QZSS. For example, to enable QZSS L1C/A and QZSS L1SAIF, set the gnssId to 5 (for QZSS) and sigCfgMask to 0x05. If supported by the firmware, L1SAIF would then be enabled.

## **QZSS Signal configuration for UBX-CFG-GNSS**

| GnssId | Description | Signal mask        |  |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|--|
| 5      | QZSS        | 0x01 = QZSS L1C/A  |  |
|        |             | 0x04 = QZSS L1SAIF |  |

## <span id="page-29-1"></span>**5 SBAS Configuration Settings Description**

## <span id="page-29-2"></span>**5.1 SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation Systems)**

SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) is an augmentation technology for GPS, which calculates GPS integrity and correction data with RIMS (Ranging and Integrity Monitoring Stations) on the ground and uses geostationary satellites to broadcast GPS integrity and correction data to GPS users. The correction data is transmitted on the GPS L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz), and therefore no additional receiver is required to make use of the correction and integrity data.

u-blox receivers will only process corrections for GPS. Other corrections are not applied, even if, as planned, some SBAS satellites start to transmit them (e.g. SDCM for GLONASS).





## **SBAS Principle**

There are several compatible SBAS systems available or in development all around the world:

- WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System) for North America has been in operation since 2003.
- MSAS (Multi-Functional Satellite Augmentation System) for Japan has been in operation since 2007.
- EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) has been in operation since 2009.
- GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation), for India has been in operation since 2014.
- SDCM (System for Differential Corrections and Monitoring), for Russia is at the time of writing in test mode.

Support of SBAS allows u-blox GPS technology to take full advantage of the augmentation systems that are currently available (i.e. WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, GAGAN). Signals from systems currently being tested and/or planned (such as SDCM) may also work, when those systems become fully operational, but this cannot be relied upon and u-blox receivers are not configured to support them by default.

With SBAS enabled, the user benefits from additional satellites for ranging (navigation). u-blox GPS technology uses the available SBAS satellites for navigation just like GPS satellites, if the SBAS satellites offer this service.

To improve position accuracy, SBAS uses different types of correction data:

- **Fast Corrections** for short-term disturbances in GPS signals (due to clock problems, etc.).
- **Long-term corrections** for GPS clock problems, broadcast orbit errors etc.
- **Ionosphere corrections** for Ionosphere activity

Another benefit of SBAS is the use of GPS integrity information. In this way SBAS control stations can 'disable' the use of GPS satellites within a 6-second alarm time in case of major GPS satellite problems. If integrity monitoring is enabled, u-blox GPS technology only uses satellites, for which



integrity information is available.

## <span id="page-31-0"></span>**5.2 SBAS Features**

This u-blox SBAS implementation is, in accordance with standard RTCA/DO-229D, a class Beta-1 equipment. All timeouts etc. are chosen for the En Route Case. Do not use this equipment under any circumstances for "safety of life" applications!

u-blox receivers are capable of receiving multiple SBAS signals concurrently, even from different SBAS systems (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, etc.). They can be tracked and used for navigation simultaneously. Every tracked SBAS satellite utilizes one vacant receiver tracking channel. Only the number of receiver channels limits the total number of satellites used. Every SBAS satellite that broadcasts ephemeris or almanac information can be used for navigation, just like a normal GPS satellite.

For receiving correction data, the u-blox receiver automatically chooses the best SBAS satellite as its primary source. It will select only one since the information received from other SBAS satellites is redundant and/or could be inconsistent. The selection strategy is determined by the proximity of the satellites, the services offered by the satellite, the configuration of the receiver (Testmode allowed/disallowed, Integrity enabled/disabled) and the signal link quality to the satellite.

If corrections are available from the chosen SBAS satellite and used in the navigation calculation, the DGPS flag is set in the receiver's output protocol messages (see [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1), [UBX-NAV-SOL](#page-400-1), [UBX-NAV-STATUS](#page-402-1), [UBX-NAV-SVINFO](#page-404-1), [NMEA Position Fix Flags description\)](#page-155-1). The message [UBX-](#page-397-1)[NAV-SBAS](#page-397-1) provides detailed information about which corrections are available and applied.

The most important SBAS feature for accuracy improvement is Ionosphere correction. The measured data from regional RIMS stations are combined to make a TEC (Total Electron Content) Map. This map is transferred to the receiver via the satellites to allow a correction of the



ionosphere error on each received satellite.

## **Supported SBAS messages**

Each satellite services a specific region and its correction signal is only useful within that region. Planning is crucial to determine the best possible configuration, especially in areas where signals from different SBAS systems can be received:

## **Example 1: SBAS Receiver in North America**

In the eastern parts of North America, make sure that EGNOS satellites do not take preference over WAAS satellites. The satellite signals from the EGNOS system should be disallowed by using the PRN Mask.

## **Example 2: SBAS Receiver in Europe**

Some WAAS satellite signals can be received in the western parts of Europe, therefore it is recommended that the satellites from all but the EGNOS system should be disallowed using the PRN Mask.

- Although u-blox receivers try to select the best available SBAS correction data, it is recommended to configure them to disallow using unwanted SBAS satellites.
- The EGNOS SBAS system does not provide the satellite ranging function.

## <span id="page-33-0"></span>**6 QZSS L1S SLAS Configuration Settings Description**

## <span id="page-33-1"></span>**6.1 QZSS L1S SLAS (Sub-meter Level Augmentation Service)**

The L1S signal was formerly known as L1SAIF.

QZSS SLAS (Sub-meter Level Augmentation Service) is an augmentation technology, which provides correction data for pseudoranges of GPS and QZSS satellites (as of October 2017). Ground monitoring stations (GMS) positioned in Japan calculate independent corrections for each visible satellite and broadcast this data to the user via QZSS satellites. The correction stream is transmitted on the L1 frequency (1575.42 Mhz) and therefore no additional receiver is required to make use of the correction data.

With QZSS SLAS enabled, u-blox receivers autonomously select the most suitable GMS based on the user's location. The correction stream of this GMS will then be applied to the measurements in order to improve position accuracy.

Furthermore, QZSS SLAS provides the user with reports for disaster and crisis management (DC Reports) from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and other sources. Those reports are provided by [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) messages.

For more information on QZSS SLAS, refer to the Interface Document IS-QZSS-L1S-001 (March 28, 2017) issued by the Cabinet Office, available from [qzss.go.jp/en/](http://qzss.go.jp/en/).

## <span id="page-33-2"></span>**6.2 QZSS L1S SLAS Features**

Multiple SLAS signals can be tracked simultaneously. Only the number of receiver channels limits the total number of satellites tracked.

The correction stream will be automatically detected from the most suitable ground monitoring stations and QZSS satellites. The selection of the QZSS satellite is dependent on the quality of the signals and the receiver configuration to allow satellites in test mode. The GMS that is not flagged as unhealthy and is closest to the user will be selected. If the distance to the closest GMS exceeds 200 km, no corrections will be used. The receiver might then fall back to using SBAS corrections. Changes of the most suitable GMS or QZSS satellite as well as transitions in the provided correction data stream will be handled in the background leading to a continuous set of corrections for the navigation solution, if possible.

If corrections are available from the chosen QZSS satellite and used in the navigation calculation,



the DGNSS flag is set in the receiver's output protocol messages (see [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1), [UBX-NAV-SOL](#page-400-1), [UBX-NAV-STATUS](#page-402-1), [UBX-NAV-SVINFO](#page-404-1), [NMEA Position Fix Flags description\)](#page-155-1). The message [UBX-](#page-399-1)[NAV-SLAS](#page-399-1) provides detailed information about which corrections are available and applied.

By setting the RAIM feature (see [UBX-CFG-SLAS](#page-276-1)), the user can setup the receiver to provide DGPS-only solutions or to mix corrected and uncorrected measurements.

If in [UBX-CFG-SLAS](#page-276-1) the RAIM option is set, other GNSS time systems than the QZSS time system can't be observed by measurements.

## **QZSS L1S SLAS Configuration parameters**

## <span id="page-34-1"></span>**7 IMES Description**

Indoor MEssaging System (IMES) is an extension to the QZSS specification using ground based beacons that broadcast their location. Its purpose is to allow GNSS users to continue to navigate inside buildings, when they can no longer reliably receive satellite based signals.

Operation of IMES beacons is only allowed within Japan.

u-blox receivers with IMES enabled conform to **IS-QZSS v1.5** and do not support v1.4 or earlier IMES signals. In particular, u-blox receivers rely on the IMES station's carrier frequency being 1575.4282MHz Â± 0.2ppm as specified in the IMES specification. Transmissions from IMES stations that are not within this frequency range are unlikely to be reliably received. Also the receiver expects the preamble 0x9E as well as the correct sequence of CNT values as specified by the IS-QZSS.

u-blox receivers report the position information they receive from IMES transmitters directly with [UBX-RXM-IMES](#page-417-0). They do not, however, combine this information with navigation solutions derived from satellite signals (reported via various NMEA and UBX-NAV messages). Consequently, the



IMES position information may not always be consistent with satellite signal derived position information.

## <span id="page-35-0"></span>**7.1 IMES Features**

- **50/250bps Auto-Detection:** Both 50bps and 250bps IMES signals are supported by u-blox receivers. The transmitter's data rate is detected automatically which allows the receiver to even work in a mixed 50bps/250bps IMES environment.
- **Dynamic Tracking Channel Allocation:** The allocation of the tracking channels is done dynamically, in the same way that channels are allocated to other GNSS. If sufficient IMES stations are within reach of the receiver, it will track as many signals as it can up to the value of maxTrkCh configured in [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1) (8 by default). To reserve a certain number of channels for IMES only (preventing them from being dynamically allocated to other GNSS), set the resTrkCh field in [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1) accordingly.
- **Data summary:** A summary of all the tracked IMES signals and what position information they are providing is given in the [UBX-RXM-IMES](#page-417-0) message.
- **Raw IMES frames:** The raw IMES subframes received from the IMES stations are reported as they are received with [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) messages.

This section relates to the configuration message [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1).

## <span id="page-35-2"></span>**8.1 Platform settings**

u-blox receivers support different dynamic platform models (see table below) to adjust the navigation engine to the expected application environment. These platform settings can be changed dynamically without performing a power cycle or reset. The settings improve the receiver's interpretation of the measurements and thus provide a more accurate position output. Setting the receiver to an unsuitable platform model for the given application environment is likely to result in a loss of receiver performance and position accuracy.

Dynamic platforms designed for high acceleration systems (e.g. airborne <2g) can result in a higher standard deviation in the reported position.

If a sanity check against a limit of the dynamic platform model fails, then the position solution is invalidated. The table above shows the types of sanity checks which are applied for a particular dynamic platform model.

## <span id="page-37-0"></span>**8.3 Navigation Output Filters**

The result of a navigation solution is initially classified by the fix type (as detailed in the fixType field of [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message). This distinguishes between failures to obtain a fix at all ("No Fix") and cases where a fix has been achieved, which are further subdivided into specific types of fixes (e.g. 2D, 3D, dead reckoning).

Where a fix has been achieved, a check is made to determine whether the fix should be classified as valid or not. A fix is only valid if it passes the navigation output filters as defined in [UBX-CFG-](#page-230-1)[NAV5](#page-230-1). In particular, both PDOP and accuracy values must lie below the respective limits.

Valid fixes are marked using the valid flag in certain NMEA messages (see [Position Fix Flags in](#page-155-1) [NMEA\)](#page-155-1) and the gnssFixOK flag in [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message.

- Important: Users are recommended to check the gnssFixOK flag in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) or the NMEA valid flag. Fixes not marked valid should not normally be used.
- The [UBX-NAV-SOL](#page-400-1) and [UBX-NAV-STATUS](#page-402-1) messages also report whether a fix is valid in their gpsFixOK and GPSfixOk flags. These messages have only been retained for backwards compatibility and users are recommended to use the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message in preference.

The [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1) message also defines TDOP and time accuracy values that are used in order to establish whether a fix is regarded as locked to GNSS or not, and as a consequence of this, which time pulse setting has to be used. Fixes that do not meet both criteria will be regarded as unlocked to GNSS, and the corresponding time pulse settings of [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) will be used to generate a time pulse.

## <span id="page-37-1"></span>**8.3.1 Speed (3-D) Low-pass Filter**

The [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message offers the possibility to activate a speed (3-D) low-pass filter. The output of the speed low-pass filter is published in the [UBX-NAV-VELNED](#page-416-1) message (speed field). The filtering level can be set via the [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message (velLpGain field) and must be comprised between 0 (heavy low-pass filtering) and 255 (weak low-pass filtering).

The internal filter gain is computed as a function of speed. Therefore, the level as defined in the [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message (velLpGain field) defines the nominal filtering level for speeds below 5m/s.

## <span id="page-37-2"></span>**8.3.2 Course over Ground Low-pass Filter**

The [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message offers the possibility to activate a course over ground low-pass filter when the speed is below 8m/s. The output of the course over ground (also named heading of motion 2-D) low-pass filter is published in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message (headMot field), [UBX-NAV-](#page-416-1)[VELNED](#page-416-1) message (heading field), [NMEA-RMC](#page-171-1) message (cog field) and [NMEA-VTG](#page-175-1) message (cogt field). The filtering level can be set via the [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message (cogLpGain field) and must be comprised between 0 (heavy low-pass filtering) and 255 (weak low-pass filtering).

The filtering level as defined in the [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message (cogLpGain field) defines the filter gain for speeds below 8m/s. If the speed is higher than 8m/s, no course over ground low-pass filtering is performed.



## <span id="page-38-0"></span>**8.3.3 Low-speed Course Over Ground Filter**

The [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message offers the possibility to activate a low-speed course over ground filter (also called heading of motion 2-D). This filter derives the course over ground from position at very low speed. The output of the low-speed course over ground filter is published in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message (headMot field), [UBX-NAV-VELNED](#page-416-1) message (heading field), [NMEA-RMC](#page-171-1) message (cog field) and [NMEA-VTG](#page-175-1) message (cogt field). If the low-speed course over ground filter is not activated or inactive, then the course over ground is computed as described in section [Freezing](#page-38-2) [the Course Over Ground.](#page-38-2)

## <span id="page-38-1"></span>**8.4 Static Hold**

Static Hold Mode allows the navigation algorithms to decrease the noise in the position output when the velocity is below a pre-defined 'Static Hold Threshold'. This reduces the position wander caused by environmental factors such as multi-path and improves position accuracy especially in stationary applications. By default, static hold mode is disabled.

If the speed drops below the defined 'Static Hold Threshold, the Static Hold Mode will be activated. Once Static Hold Mode has been entered, the position output is kept static and the velocity is set to zero until there is evidence of movement again. Such evidence can be velocity, acceleration, changes of the valid flag (e.g. position accuracy estimate exceeding the Position Accuracy Mask, see also section [Navigation Output Filters](#page-37-0)), position displacement, etc.

The [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1) message additionally allows for configuration of distance threshold (field staticHoldMaxDist). If the estimated position is farther away from the static hold position than this threshold, static mode will be quit.

## <span id="page-38-2"></span>**8.5 Freezing the Course Over Ground**

If the low-speed course over ground filter is deactivated or inactive (see section [Low-speed Course](#page-38-0) [over Ground Filter\)](#page-38-0), the receiver derives the course over ground from the GNSS velocity information. If the velocity cannot be calculated with sufficient accuracy (e.g., with bad signals) or if the absolute speed value is very low (under 0.1m/s) then the course over ground value becomes inaccurate too. In this case the course over ground value is frozen, i.e. the previous value is kept and its accuracy is degraded over time. These frozen values will not be output in the NMEA messages [NMEA-RMC](#page-171-1) and [NMEA-VTG](#page-175-1) unless the NMEA protocol is explicitely configured to do so (see [NMEA Protocol Configuration](#page-153-0)).

## <span id="page-38-3"></span>**8.6 Degraded Navigation**

Degraded navigation describes all navigation modes which use less than four Satellite Vehicles (SV).

## <span id="page-38-4"></span>**8.6.1 2D Navigation**

If the receiver only has three SVs for calculating a position, the navigation algorithm uses a constant altitude to compensate for the missing fourth SV. When an SV is lost after a successful 3D fix (min. four SVs available), the altitude is kept constant at the last known value. This is called a 2D fix.

u-blox receivers do not calculate any navigation solution with less than three SVs. Only ublox Timing products can calculate a timing solution with only one SV when they are in stationary mode.



## <span id="page-39-0"></span>**8.7 Geodetic Coordinate Systems and Ellipsoids**

In order to have any useful meaning, the positions reported by a u-blox receiver must be referenced to some coordinate system which defines the origin and, for example, which way is "up". For many reasons, including history, practical autonomy and politics, all the major GNSS define their own theoretical coordinate systems from which they realize a practical reference frame by means of a network of reference points. Specifically:

- GPS uses WGS84
- GLONASS uses PZ90
- Galileo uses GTRF
- BeiDou uses CGCS2000

In practice, the relevant organisations choose to keep their respective frames very close to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), defined and managed by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). However, because the Earth's tectonic plates and even parts of the Earth's core move, new versions of ITRF are defined every few years, generally with changes of the order of a few millimetres. Consequently, the major GNSS occasionally decide that they need to update their reference frames to be better aligned to the latest ITRF. So, for example, GPS switched to WGS84 (G1150) in GPS week 1150 (early 2002) based on ITRF2000, while GLONASS switched from PZ90.02 to PZ90.11 at the end of 2013, based on ITRF2008. The net effect of this, is that all the major GNSS use almost the same reference frame, but there are some small (generally sub-cm) differences between them and these differences occasionally change.

In order to produce positions that can be shown on a map, it is necessary to translate between raw coordinates (e.g. x, y, z) and a position relative to the Earth's surface (e.g. latitude, longitude and altitude) and that requires defining the form of ellipsoid that best matches the shape of the Earth. Historically many different ellipsoid definitions have been used for maps, many of which predate the existence of GNSS and show quite significant differences, leading to discrepencies of as much as 100 m in places. Fortunately, most digital maps now use the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is distinct from the WGS84 coordinate system, but defined by the same body.

All u-blox receivers use (the current) version of WGS84 frame as their reference frame, carrying out any necessary corrections internally. What is more, by default, u-blox receivers use the WGS84 ellipsoid and therefore all positions communicated from/to a u-blox receiver will be relative to that. However, users can alter this by specifying their chosen geodetic datum parameters using the [UBX-CFG-DAT](#page-209-1) message. The table below indicates the values u-blox recommends for use.

| Ellipsoid       | majA      | flat          | dX  | dY  | dZ  | rotX | rotY | rotZ |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|
| WGS84 (default) | 6378137.0 | 298.257223563 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0  |
| PZ90            | 6378136.0 | 298.257839303 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0  |
| CGCS2000        | 6378137.0 | 298.257227101 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0  | 0.0  | 0.0  |

## **Recommended UBX-CFG-DAT parameters**

Where the receiver is configured to use differential correction data (e.g. via an RTCM stream), as a direct consequence, the receiver's coordinate frame will switch to whatever frame the source of correction data is using.



## <span id="page-40-0"></span>**9 Clocks and Time**

## <span id="page-40-1"></span>**9.1 Receiver Local Time**

The receiver is dependent on a local oscillator (normally a TCXO or Crystal oscillator) for both the operation of its radio parts and also for timing within its signal processing. No matter what nominal frequency the local oscillator has (e.g. 26 MHz), u-blox receivers subdivide the oscillator signal to provide a 1 kHz reference clock signal, which is used to drive many of the receiver's processes. In particular, the measurement of satellite signals is arranged to be synchronised with the "ticking" of this 1 kHz clock signal.

When the receiver first starts, it has no information about how these clock ticks relate to other time systems; it can only count time in 1 millisecond steps. However, as the receiver derives information from the satellites it is tracking or from aiding messages, it estimates the time that each 1 kHz clock tick takes in the time-base of the relevant GNSS system. In previous generations of u-blox receivers this was always the GPS time-base, but for this generation it could be GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, or BeiDou. This estimate of GNSS time based on the local 1 kHz clock is called **receiver local time**.

As receiver local time is a mapping of the local 1 kHz reference onto a GNSS time-base, it may experience occasional discontinuities, especially when the receiver first starts up and the information it has about the time-base is changing. Indeed after a cold start receiver local time will initially indicate the length of time that the receiver has been running. However, when the receiver obtains some credible timing information from a satellite or aiding message, it will jump to an estimate of GNSS time.

## <span id="page-40-2"></span>**9.2 Navigation Epochs**

Each navigation solution is triggered by the tick of the 1 kHz clock nearest to the desired navigation solution time. This tick is referred to as a **navigation epoch**. If the navigation solution attempt is successful, one of the results is an accurate measurement of time in the time-base of the chosen GNSS system, called **GNSS system time**. The difference between the calculated GNSS system time and receiver local time is called the **clock bias** (and the **clock drift** is the rate at which this bias is changing).

In practice the receiver's local oscillator will not be as stable as the atomic clocks to which GNSS systems are referenced and consequently clock bias will tend to accumulate. However, when selecting the next navigation epoch, the receiver will always try to use the 1 kHz clock tick which it estimates to be closest to the desired fix period as measured in GNSS system time. Consequently the number of 1 kHz clock ticks between fixes will occasionally vary (so when producing one fix per second, there will normally be 1000 clock ticks between fixes, but sometimes, to correct drift away from GNSS system time, there will be 999 or 1001).

The GNSS system time calculated in the navigation solution is always converted to a time in both the GPS and UTC time-bases for output.

Clearly when the receiver has chosen to use the GPS time-base for its GNSS system time, conversion to GPS time requires no work at all, but conversion to UTC requires knowledge of the number of leap seconds since GPS time started (and other minor correction terms). The relevant GPS to UTC conversion parameters are transmitted periodically (every 12.5 minutes) by GPS satellites, but can also be supplied to the receiver via the [UBX-MGA-GPS-UTC](#page-340-0) aiding message. By contrast when the receiver has chosen to use the GLONASS time-base as its GNSS system time,



conversion to GPS time is more difficult as it requires knowledge of the difference between the two time-bases, but conversion to UTC is easier (as GLONASS time is closely linked to UTC).

Where insufficient information is available for the receiver to perform any of these time-base conversions precisely, pre-defined default offsets are used. Consequently plausible times are nearly always generated, but they may be wrong by a few seconds (especially shortly after receiver start). Depending on the configuration of the receiver, such "invalid" times may well be output, but with flags indicating their state (e.g. the "valid" flags in [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1)).

u-blox receivers employ multiple GNSS system times and/or receiver local times (in order to support multiple GNSS systems concurrently), so users should not rely on UBX messages that report GNSS system time or receiver local time being supported in future. It is therefore recommended to give preference to those messages that report UTC time.

## <span id="page-41-0"></span>**9.3 iTOW Timestamps**

All the main UBX-NAV messages (and some other messages) contain an **iTOW** field which indicates the GPS time at which the navigation epoch occurred. Messages with the same iTOW value can be assumed to have come from the same navigation solution.

Note that iTOW values may not be valid (i.e. they may have been generated with insufficient conversion data) and therefore it is not recommended to use the iTOW field for any other purpose.

The original designers of GPS chose to express time/date as an integer week number (starting with the first full week in January 1980) and a time of week (often abbreviated to TOW) expressed in seconds. Manipulating time/date in this form is far easier for digital systems than the more "conventional" year/month/day, hour/minute/second representation. Consequently, most GNSS receivers use this representation internally, only converting to a more "conventional form" at external interfaces. The iTOW field is the most obvious externally visible consequence of this internal representation.

If reliable absolute time information is required, users are recommended to use the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) or [UBX-HNR-PVT](#page-302-1) navigation solution messages which also contain additional fields that indicate the validity (and accuracy in [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1)) of the calculated times (see also the [GNSS Times](#page-41-1) section below for further messages containing time information).

## <span id="page-41-1"></span>**9.4 GNSS Times**

Each GNSS has its own time reference for which detailed and reliable information is provided in the messages listed in the table below.

## **GNSS Times**

| Time Reference | Message         |
|----------------|-----------------|
| GPS Time       | UBX-NAV-TIMEGPS |
| BeiDou Time    | UBX-NAV-TIMEBDS |
| GLONASS Time   | UBX-NAV-TIMEGLO |
| Galileo Time   | UBX-NAV-TIMEGAL |
| UTC Time       | UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC |



## <span id="page-42-0"></span>**9.5 Time Validity**

Information about the validity of the time solution is given in the following form:

- **Time validity**: Information about time validity is provided in the valid flags (e.g. validDate and validTime flags in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message). If these flags are set, the time is known and considered as valid for being used. These flags can be found in the GNSS Times table in the [GNSS Times](#page-41-1) section above as well as in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) and [UBX-HNR-PVT](#page-302-1) messages.
- **Time validity confirmation**: Information about confirmed validity is provided in the confirmedDate and confirmedTime flags in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message. If these flags are set, the time validity could be confirmed by using an additional independent source, meaning that the probability of the time to be correct is very high. Note that information about time validity confirmation is only available if the confirmedAvai bit in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message is set. Check [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) which Protocol Version supports this flag.

## <span id="page-42-1"></span>**9.6 UTC Representation**

UTC time is used in many NMEA and UBX messages. In NMEA messages it is always reported rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second. Consequently, it is normally reported with two decimal places (e.g. 124923.52). What is more, although compatibility mode (selected using [UBX-](#page-240-1)[CFG-NMEA](#page-240-1)) requires three decimal places, rounding to the nearest hundredth of a second remains, so the extra digit is always 0.

UTC time is is also reported within some UBX messages, such as [UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC](#page-414-1) and [UBX-NAV-](#page-389-1)[PVT](#page-389-1). In these messages date and time are separated into seven distinct integer fields. Six of these (year, month, day, hour, min and sec) have fairly obvious meanings and are all guaranteed to match the corresponding values in NMEA messages generated by the same navigation epoch. This facilitates simple synchronisation between associated UBX and NMEA messages.

The seventh field is called nano and it contains the number of nanoseconds by which the rest of the time and date fields need to be corrected to get the precise time. So, for example, the UTC time 12:49:23.521 would be reported as: hour: 12, min: 49, sec: 23, nano: 521000000.

It is however important to note that the first six fields are the result of rounding to the nearest hundredth of a second. Consequently the nano value can range from -5000000 (i.e. -5 ms) to +994999999 (i.e. nearly 995 ms).

When the nano field is negative, the number of seconds (and maybe minutes, hours, days, months or even years) will have been rounded up. Therefore, some or all of them will need to be adjusted in order to get the correct time and date. Thus in an extreme example, the UTC time 23:59:59.9993 on 31st December 2011 would be reported as: year: 2012, month: 1, day: 1, hour: 0, min: 0, sec: 0, nano: -700000.

Of course, if a resolution of one hundredth of a second is adequate, negative nano values can simply be rounded up to 0 and effectively ignored.

Which master clock the UTC time is referenced to is output in the message [UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC](#page-414-1).

For [protocol versions 16 or greater,](#page-14-0) the preferred variant of UTC time can be specified using [UBX-](#page-230-1)[CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1).

## <span id="page-42-2"></span>**9.7 Leap Seconds**

Occasionally it is decided (by one of the international time keeping bodies) that, due to the slightly uneven spin rate of the Earth, UTC has moved sufficiently out of alignment with mean solar time (i.e. the Sun no longer appears directly overhead at 0 longitude at midday). A "leap second" is



therefore announced to bring UTC back into close alignment. This normally involves adding an extra second to the last minute of the year, but it can also happen on 30th June. When this happens UTC clocks are expected to go from 23:59:59 to 23:59:60 and only then on to 00:00:00.

It is also theoretically possible to have a negative leap second, in which case there will only be 59 seconds in a minute and 23:59:58 will be followed by 00:00:00.

u-blox receivers are designed to handle leap seconds in their UTC output and consequently users processing UTC times from either NMEA and UBX messages should be prepared to handle minutes that are either 59 or 61 seconds long.

Leap second information be be polled from the u-blox receiver with the message [UBX-NAV-TIMELS](#page-412-1) for [Protocol Version 18 and above.](#page-15-2)

## <span id="page-43-0"></span>**9.8 Real Time Clock**

u-blox receivers contain circuitry to support a **real time clock**, which (if correctly fitted and powered) keeps time while the receiver is otherwise powered off. When the receiver powers up, it attempts to use the real time clock to initialise receiver local time and in most cases this leads to appreciably faster first fixes.

## <span id="page-43-1"></span>**9.9 Date**

All GNSS frequently transmit information about the current time within their data message. In most cases, this is a time of week (often abbreviated to TOW), which indicates the elapsed number of seconds since the start of the week (midnight Saturday/Sunday). In order to map this to a full date, it is necessary to know which week and so the GNSS also transmit a week number, typically every 30 seconds. Unfortunately the GPS data message was designed in a way that only allows the bottom 10 bits of the week number to be transmitted. This is not sufficient to yield a completely unambiguous date as every 1024 weeks (a bit less than 20 years), the transmitted week number value "rolls over" back to zero. Consequently, GPS receivers can't tell the difference between, for example, 1980, 1999 or 2019 etc.

Fortunately, although BeiDou and Galileo have similar representations of time, they transmit sufficient bits for the week number to be unambiguous for the forseeable future (the first ambiguity will be in 2078 for Galileo and not until 2163 for BeiDou). GLONASS has a different structure, based on a time of day, but again transmits sufficient information to avoid any ambiguity during the expected lifetime of the system (the first ambiguous date will be in 2124). Therefore, u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 receivers using [Protocol Version 18 and above](#page-15-2) regard the date information transmitted by GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo to be unambiguous and, where necessary, use this to resolve any ambiguity in the GPS date.

Customers attaching u-blox receivers to simulators should be aware that GPS time is referenced to 6th January 1980, GLONASS to 1st January 1996, Galileo to 22nd August 1999 and BeiDou to 1st January 2006; the receiver cannot be expected to work reliably with signals that appear to come from before these dates.

## <span id="page-43-2"></span>**9.9.1 GPS-only Date Resolution**

In circumstances where only GPS signals are available and for receivers with earlier firmware versions, the receiver establishes the date by assuming that all week numbers must be at least as large as a reference rollover week number. This reference rollover week number is hard-coded into the firmware at compile time and is normally set a few weeks before the s/w is completed, but it can be overridden by the wknRollover field of the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) message to any value the user



wishes.

The following example illustrates how this works: Assume that the reference rollover week number set in the firmware at compile time is 1524 (which corresponds to a week in calendar year 2009, but would be transmitted by the satellites as 500). In this case, if the receiver sees transmissions containing week numbers in the range 500 ... 1023, these will be interpreted as week numbers 1524 ... 2047 (CY 2009 ... 2019), whereas transmissions with week numbers from 0 to 499 are interpreted as week numbers 2048 ... 2547 (CY 2019 ... 2028).

It is important to set the reference rollover week number appropriately when supplying ublox receivers with simulated signals, especially when the scenarios are in the past.

## <span id="page-44-0"></span>**10 Broadcast Navigation Data**

Reporting of broadcast navigation data is supported for products using protocol version 17 onwards.

The [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) reports the broadcast navigation data message collected by the receiver from each tracked signal. When enabled, a separate message is generated every time the receiver decodes a complete subframe of data from a tracked signal. The data bits are reported, as received, including preambles and error checking bits as appropriate. However because there is considerable variation in the data structure of the different GNSS signals, the form of the reported data also varies. Indeed, although this document uses the term "subframe" generically, it is not strictly the correct term for all GNSS (e.g. GLONASS has "strings" and Galileo has "pages").

## <span id="page-44-1"></span>**10.1 Parsing Navigation Data Subframes**

Each [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message contains a subframe of data bits appropriate for the relevant GNSS, delivered in a number of 32 bit words, as indicated by numWords field.

Due to the variation in data structure between different GNSS, the most important step in parsing a [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message is to identify the form of the data. This should be done by reading the gnssId field, which indicates which GNSS the data was decoded from. In almost all cases, this is sufficient to indicate the structure and the following sections are organised by GNSS for that reason. However, in some cases the identity of the GNSS is not sufficient, and this is described, where appropriate, in the following sections.

In most cases, the data does not map perfectly into a number of 32 bit words and, consequently, some of the words reported in [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) messages contain fields marked as "Pad". These fields should be ignored and no assumption should be made about their contents.

[UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) messages are only generated when complete subframes are detected by the receiver and all appropriate parity checks have passed.

Where the parity checking algorithm requires data to be inverted before it is decoded (e.g. GPS L1C/A), the receiver carries this out before the message output. Therefore, users can process data directly and do not need to worry about repeating any parity processing.

The meaning of the content of each subframe depends on the sending GNSS and is described in the relevant Interface Control Documents (ICD).

## <span id="page-44-2"></span>**10.2 GPS**

The data structure in the GPS L1C/A and L2C signals is dissimilar and thus the [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message structure differs as well. For the GPS L1C/A and L2C signals it is as follows.



### <span id="page-45-0"></span>**10.2.1 GPS L1C/A**

For GPS L1C/A signals, there is a fairly straightforward mapping between the reported subframe and the structure of subframe and words described in the GPS ICD. Each subframe comprises ten data words, which are reported in the same order they are received.

Each word is arranged as follows:

| <b>MSB</b>      |               |                 |                  |  |  |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|--|--|
| $\frac{10}{10}$ | Pad<br>2 bits | Data<br>24 bits | Parity<br>6 bits |  |  |

Note that as the GPS data words only comprise 30 bits, the 2 most significant bits in each word reported by [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) are padding and should be ignored.

## <span id="page-45-1"></span>**10.3 GLONASS**

For GLONASS L1OF and L2OF signals, each reported subframe contains a string as described in the GLONASS ICD. This string comprises 85 data bits which are reported over three 32 bit words in the [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message. Data bits 1 to 8 are always a hamming code, whilst bits 81 to 84 are a string number and bit 85 is the idle chip, which should always have a value of zero. The meaning of other bits vary with string and frame number.

The fourth and final 32 bit word in the [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message contains frame and superframe numbers (where available). These values aren't actually transmitted by the SVs, but are deduced by the receiver and are included to aid decoding of the transmitted data. However, the receiver does not always know these values, in which case a value of zero is reported.



The four words are arranged as follows:

In some circumstances, (especially on startup) the receiver may be able to decode data from a GLONASS SV before it can identify the SV. When this occurs [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) messages will be issued with an svId of 255 to indicate "unknown".



## <span id="page-46-0"></span>**10.4 BeiDou**

For BeiDou (B1I) signals, there is a fairly straightforward mapping between the reported subframe and the structure of subframe and words described in the BeiDou ICD. Each subframe comprises ten data words, which are reported in the same order they are received.

Each word is arranged as follows:

| <b>MSB</b>      |               |                 |                  |  |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|--|
| $\frac{10}{10}$ | Pad<br>2 bits | Data<br>22 bits | Parity<br>8 bits |  |

Note that as the BeiDou data words only comprise 30 bits, the 2 most significant bits in each word reported by [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) are padding and should be ignored.

## <span id="page-46-1"></span>**10.5 Galileo**

The Galileo E1OS and E5b signals both transmit the I/NAV message but in different configurations. The [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) structures for them are as follows.

## <span id="page-46-2"></span>**10.5.1 Galileo E1OS**

For Galileo E1OS signals, each reported subframe contains a pair of I/NAV pages as described in the Galileo ICD.

Galileo pages can either be "Nominal" or "Alert" pages. For Nominal pages the eight words are arranged as follows:





Alert pages are reported in very similar manner, but the page type bits will have value 1 and the structure of the eight words will be slightly different (as indicated by the Galileo ICD).

## <span id="page-47-0"></span>**10.6 SBAS**

For SBAS (L1C/A) signals each reported subframe contains eight 32 data words to deliver the 250 bits transmitted in each SBAS data block.

The eight words are arranged as follows:





## <span id="page-48-0"></span>**10.7 QZSS**

The structure of the data delivered by QZSS L1C/A signals is effectively identical to that of [GPS](#page-44-2) [\(L1C/A\).](#page-44-2) Similarly the QZSS L2C signal is effectively identical to the [GPS \(L2C\)](#page-44-2).

The QZSS (L1SAIF) signal is different and uses the same data block format as used by [SBAS](#page-47-0) [\(L1C/A\).](#page-47-0) QZSS (SAIF) signals can be distinguished from QZSS (L1C/A and L2C) by noting that they have 8 words, instead of 10 for QZSS (L1C/A and L2C).

## <span id="page-48-1"></span>**10.8 IMES**

Data messages from IMES are of variable length and u-blox receivers currently support the following varieties:

- Short comprising of a single word
- Medium comprising of two words
- Position 1 comprising of three words
- Position 2 comprising of four words

As a consequence, an IMES [UBX-RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message may have a numWords value of 1, 2, 3 or 4.

In all cases the structure of words follows the same pattern, with the first word being different from any/all subsequent words as indicated by the following diagram:

|                                        | <b>MSB</b>    |                 |                    |                           |                 | <b>LSB</b>       |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1                                      | Pad<br>2 bits |                 | Preamble<br>8 bits | Message<br>Type<br>3 bits | Data<br>13 bits | Parity<br>6 bits |
|                                        |               |                 |                    |                           |                 |                  |
| $\overline{2}$<br>to<br>$\overline{4}$ | Pad<br>2 bits | Count<br>3 bits |                    |                           | Data<br>21 bits | Parity<br>6 bits |

## <span id="page-48-2"></span>**10.9 Summary**

The following table gives a summary of the different data message formats reported by the [UBX-](#page-433-1)[RXM-SFRBX](#page-433-1) message.

## **Data message formats reported by UBX-RXM-SFRBX**

## <span id="page-49-0"></span>**11 Serial Communication Ports Description**

u-blox receivers come with a highly flexible communication interface. It supports the NMEA and the proprietary UBX protocols, and is truly multi-port and multi-protocol capable. Each protocol (UBX, NMEA) can be assigned to several ports at the same time (multi-port capability) with individual settings (e.g. baud rate, message rates, etc.) for each port. It is even possible to assign more than one protocol (e.g. UBX protocol and NMEA at the same time) to a single port (multiprotocol capability), which is particularly useful for debugging purposes.

To enable a message on a port, the UBX and/or NMEA protocol must be enabled on that port using the UBX proprietary message [UBX-CFG-PRT](#page-257-1). This message also allows changing port-specific settings (baud rate, address etc.). See [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1) for a description of the mechanism for enabling and disabling messages.

The following table shows the port numbers reported in the messages [UBX-MON-IO](#page-357-1), [UBX-MON-](#page-358-2)[MSGPP](#page-358-2), [UBX-MON-TXBUF](#page-368-1), [UBX-MON-RXBUF](#page-360-2). Note that any numbers not listed are reserved for future use.

## **Port Number assignment**

| Port # | Electrical Interface |
|--------|----------------------|
| 0      | DDC (I2C compatible) |
| 1      | UART 1               |
| 3      | USB                  |
| 4      | SPI                  |

## <span id="page-49-1"></span>**11.1 TX-ready indication**

This feature enables each port to define a corresponding pin, which indicates if bytes are ready to be transmitted. By default, this feature is disabled. For USB, this feature is configurable but might not behave as described below due to a different internal transmission mechanism. If the number of pending bytes reaches the threshold configured for this port, the corresponding pin will become active (configurable active-low or active-high), and stay active until the last bytes have been transferred from software to hardware (note that this is not necessarily equal to all bytes transmitted, i.e. after the pin has become inactive, up to 16 bytes can still need to be transferred to the host).



The TX-ready pin can be selected from all PIOs which are not in use (see [UBX-MON-HW](#page-356-1) for a list of the PIOs and their mapping), each TX-ready pin is exclusively for one port and cannot be shared. If the PIO is invalid or already in use, only the configuration for the TX-ready pin is ignored, the rest of the port configuration is applied if valid. The acknowledge message does not indicate if the TXready configuration is successfully set, it only indicates the successful configuration of the port. To validate successful configuration of the TX-ready pin, the port configuration should be polled and the settings of TX-ready feature verified (will be set to disabled/all zero if the settings are invalid).

The threshold should not be set above 2 kB, as the internal message buffer limit can be reached before this, resulting in the TX-ready pin never being set as messages are discarded before the threshold is reached.

## <span id="page-50-0"></span>**11.2 Extended TX timeout**

If the host does not communicate over SPI or DDC for more than approximately 2 seconds, the device assumes that the host is no longer using this interface and no more packets are scheduled for this port. This mechanism can be changed by enabling "extended TX timeouts", in which case the receiver delays idling the port until the allocated and undelivered bytes for this port reach 4 kB. This feature is especially useful when using the TX-ready feature with a message output rate of less than once per second, and polling data only when data is available, determined by the TXready pin becoming active.

## <span id="page-50-1"></span>**11.3 UART Ports**

One or two Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter ([UART](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uart)) ports are featured, that can be used to transmit GNSS measurements, monitor status information and configure the receiver. See our online product descriptions for availability.

The serial ports consist of an RX and a TX line. Neither handshaking signals nor hardware flow control signals are available. These serial ports operate in asynchronous mode. The baud rates can be configured individually for each serial port. However, there is no support for setting different baud rates for reception and transmission.

As of [Protocol version 18+](#page-15-2), the UART RX interface will be disabled when more than 100 frame errors are detected during a one-second period. This can happen if the wrong baud rate is used or the UART RX pin is grounded. The error message appears when the UART RX interface is re-enabled at the end of the one-second period.

| Baud Rate | Data Bits | Parity | Stop Bits |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 4800      | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 9600      | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 19200     | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 38400     | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 57600     | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 115200    | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 230400    | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 460800    | 8         | none   | 1         |

Note that for protocols such as NMEA or UBX, it does not make sense to change the default word length values (data bits) since these properties are defined by the protocol and not by the



electrical interface.

If the amount of data configured is too much for a certain port's bandwidth (e.g. all UBX messages output on a UART port with a baud rate of 9600), the buffer will fill up. Once the buffer space is exceeded, new messages to be sent will be dropped. To prevent message losses, the baud rate and communication speed or the number of enabled messages should be selected so that the expected number of bytes can be transmitted in less than one second.

See [UBX-CFG-PRT for UART](#page-257-1) for a description of the contents of the UART port configuration message.

## <span id="page-51-0"></span>**11.4 USB Port**

One Universal Serial Bus ([USB\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus) port is featured. See the data sheet for availability. This port can be used for communication purposes and to power the positioning chip or module.

The USB interface supports two different power modes:

- In Self Powered Mode the receiver is powered by its own power supply. **VDDUSB** is used to detect the availability of the USB port, i.e. whether the receiver is connected to a USB host.
- In Bus Powered Mode the device is powered by the USB bus, therefore no additional power supply is needed. See the table below for the default maximum current that can be drawn by the receiver. See [UBX-CFG-USB](#page-289-1) for a description on how to change this maximum. Configuring Bus Powered Mode indicates that the device will enter a low power state with disabled GNSS functionality when the host suspends the device, e.g. when the host is put into stand-by mode.

#### **Maximum Current in Bus Powered Mode**

| Generation           | Max Current |
|----------------------|-------------|
| u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 | 100 mA      |

The voltage range for **VDDUSB** is specified from 3.0 V to 3.6 V, which differs slightly from the specification for VCC.

The boot screen is retransmitted on the USB port after the enumeration. However, messages generated between boot-up of the receiver and USB enumeration are not visible on the USB port.

## <span id="page-51-1"></span>**11.5 DDC Port**

The Display Data Channel [\(DDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel)) bus is a two-wire communication interface compatible with the I2C standard [\(Inter-Integrated Circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)). See our online product selector matrix for availability.

Unlike all other interfaces, the DDC is not able to communicate in full-duplex mode, i.e. TX and RX are mutually exclusive. u-blox receivers act as a slave in the communication setup, therefore they cannot initiate data transfers on their own. The host, which is always master, provides the data clock (SCL), and the clock frequency is therefore not configurable on the slave.

The receiver's DDC address is set to 0x42 by default. This address can be changed by setting the mode field in [UBX-CFG-PRT for DDC](#page-265-0) accordingly.

As the receiver will be run in slave mode and the DDC physical layer lacks a handshake mechanism to inform the master about data availability, a layer has been inserted between the physical layer and the UBX and NMEA layer. The receiver DDC interface implements a simple streaming interface that allows the constant polling of data, discarding everything that is not parse-able. The receiver returns 0xFF if no data is available. The [TX-ready](#page-49-1) feature can be used to inform the master about data availability and can be used as a trigger for data transmission.



## <span id="page-52-0"></span>**11.5.1 Read Access**

The DDC interface allows 256 slave registers to be addressed. As shown in Figure DDC Register Layout only three of these are currently implemented. The data registers 0 to 252, at addresses 0x00 to 0xFC, each 1 byte in size, contain information to be defined later - the result of reading them is undefined. The currently available number of bytes in the message stream can be read at addresses 0xFD and 0xFE. The register at address 0xFF allows the data stream to be read. If there is no data awaiting transmission from the receiver, then this register will deliver the value 0xff, which cannot be the first byte of a valid message. If message data is ready for transmission, then successive reads of register 0xff will deliver the waiting message data.

The registers 0x00 to 0xFC are reserved for future use and may be defined in a later firmware release. Do not use them, as they don't provide any meaningful data!

## **DDC Register Layout**



## **11.5.1.1 Read Access Forms**

There are two forms of DDC read transfer. The 'random access' form includes a slave register address and thus allows any register to be read. The second 'current address' form omits the register address. If this second form is used, then an address pointer in the receiver is used to determine which register to read. This address pointer will increment after each read unless it is already pointing at register 0xff, the highest addressable register, in which case it remains unaltered. The initial value of this address pointer at start-up is 0xff, so by default all current address reads will repeatedly read register 0xff and receive the next byte of message data (or 0xff if no message data is waiting). Figure DDC Random Read Access shows the format of the random access form of the request. Following the start condition from the master, the 7-bit device address and the RW bit (which is a logic low for write access) are clocked onto the bus by the master transmitter. The receiver answers with an acknowledge (logic low) to indicate that it



recognises the address. Next, the 8-bit address of the register to be read must be written to the bus. Following the receiver's acknowledge, the master again triggers a start condition and writes the device address, but this time the RW bit is a logic high to initiate the read access. Now, the master can read 1 to N bytes from the receiver, generating a not-acknowledge and a stop condition after the last byte being read.

## **DDC Random Read Access**





## <span id="page-53-0"></span>**11.5.2 Write Access**

The receiver does not provide any write access except for writing UBX and NMEA messages to the receiver, such as configuration or aiding data. Therefore, the register set mentioned in section [Read Access](#page-52-0) is not writeable. Following the start condition from the master, the 7-bit device address and the RW bit (which is a logic low for write access) are clocked onto the bus by the master transmitter. The receiver answers with an acknowledge (logic low) to indicate that it is responsible for the given address. Now, the master can write 2 to N bytes to the receiver, generating a stop condition after the last byte being written. The number of data bytes must be at least 2 to properly distinguish from the write access to set the address counter in random read accesses.



## **DDC Write Access**



## <span id="page-54-0"></span>**11.6 SPI Port**

A Serial Peripheral Interface [\(SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus)) bus is available with selected receivers. See our online product descriptions for availability.

SPI is a four-wire synchronous communication interface. In contrast to UART, the master provides the clock signal, which therefore doesn't need to be specified for the slave in advance. Moreover, a baud rate setting is not applicable for the slave. SPI modes 0-3 are implemented and can be configured using the field mode.spiMode in [CFG-PRT for SPI](#page-262-0) (default is SPI mode 0).

The SPI clock speed is limited depending on hardware and firmware versions!

## <span id="page-54-1"></span>**11.6.1 Maximum SPI clock speed**

u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 receivers support a maximum SPI clock speed of 5.5 MHz.

## <span id="page-54-2"></span>**11.6.2 Read Access**

As the register mode is not implemented for the SPI port, only the UBX/NMEA message stream is provided. This stream is accessed using the Back-To-Back Read and Write Access (see section [Back-To-Back Read and Write Access](#page-54-3)). When no data is available to be written to the receiver, MOSI should be held logic high, i.e. all bytes written to the receiver are set to 0xFF.

To prevent the receiver from being busy parsing incoming data, the parsing process is stopped after 50 subsequent bytes containing 0xFF. The parsing process is re-enabled with the first byte not equal to 0xFF. The number of bytes to wait for deactivation (50 by default) can be adjusted using the field mode.ffCnt in [CFG-PRT for SPI](#page-262-0), which is only necessary when messages shall be sent containing a large number of subsequent 0xFF bytes.

If the receiver has no more data to send, it sets MISO to logic high, i.e. all bytes transmitted decode to 0xFF. An efficient parser in the host will ignore all 0xFF bytes which are not part of a message and will resume data processing as soon as the first byte not equal to 0xFF is received.

## <span id="page-54-3"></span>**11.6.3 Back-To-Back Read and Write Access**

The receiver does not provide any write access except for writing UBX and NMEA messages to the receiver, such as configuration or aiding data. For every byte written to the receiver, a byte will simultaneously be read from the receiver. While the master writes to MOSI, at the same time it



needs to read from MISO, as any pending data will be output by the receiver with this access. The data on MISO represents the results from a current address read, returning 0xFF when no more data is available.



## **SPI Back-To-Back Read/Write Access**

## <span id="page-55-0"></span>**11.7 How to change between protocols**

Reconfiguring a port from one protocol to another is a two-step process:

- Step 1: the preferred protocol(s) needs to be enabled on a port using [UBX-CFG-PRT](#page-257-1). One port can handle several protocols at the same time (e.g. NMEA and UBX). By default, all ports are configured for UBX and NMEA protocol so in most cases, it's not necessary to change the port settings at all. Port settings can be viewed and changed using the [UBX-CFG-PRT](#page-257-1) messages.
- Step 2: activate certain messages on each port using [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1).

## <span id="page-55-1"></span>**12 Multiple GNSS assistance (MGA)**

## <span id="page-55-2"></span>**12.1 Introduction**

Users would ideally like GNSS receivers to provide accurate position information the moment the receivers are turned on. With standard GNSS receivers there can be a significant delay in providing the first position fix, principally because the receiver needs to obtain data from several satellites and the satellites transmit that data slowly. Under adverse signal conditions, data downloads from the satellites to the receiver can take minutes, hours or even fail altogether.

Assisted GNSS (A-GNSS) is a common solution to this problem and involves some form of reference network of receivers that collect data such as ephemeris, almanac, accurate time and satellite status and pass this onto to the target receiver via any suitable communications link. Such assistance data enables the receiver to compute a position within a few seconds, even under poor signal conditions.

The UBX-MGA message class provides the means for delivering assistance data to u-blox receivers and customers can obtain it from the u-blox AssistNow Online or AssistNow Offline Services. Alternatively they can obtain assistance data from third-party sources (e.g. SUPL/RRLP) and generate the appropriate UBX-MGA messages to send this data to the receiver.



## <span id="page-56-0"></span>**12.2 Assistance Data**

u-blox receivers currently accept the following types of assistance data:

- **Position:** Estimated receiver position can be submitted to the receiver using the [UBX-MGA-INI-](#page-342-1)[POS\\_XYZ](#page-342-1) or [UBX-MGA-INI-POS\\_LLH](#page-343-0) messages.
- **Time:** The current time can either be supplied as an inexact value via the standard communication interfaces, suffering from latency depending on the baud rate, or using hardware time synchronization where an accurate time pulse is connected to an external interrupt. The preferred option is to supply UTC time using the [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) message, but times referenced to some GNSS can be delivered with the [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_](#page-345-0) [GNSS](#page-345-0) message.
- **Clock drift:** An estimate of the clock drift can be sent to the receiver using the [UBX-MGA-INI-](#page-346-0)[CLKD](#page-346-0) message.
- **Frequency:** It is possible to supply hardware frequency aiding by connecting a periodic rectangular signal with a frequency up to 500 kHz and arbitrary duty cycle (low/high phase duration must not be shorter than 50 ns) to an external interrupt, and providing the applied frequency value using the [UBX-MGA-INI-FREQ](#page-347-0) message.
- **Current orbit data:** Each different GNSS transmits orbit data in slightly different forms. For each system there are separate messages for delivering ephemeris and almanac. So for example GPS ephemeris is delivered to the receiver using the [UBX-MGA-GPS-EPH](#page-337-1) message, while GLONASS almanac is delivered with the [UBX-MGA-GLO-ALM](#page-335-0) message.
- **Predicted orbit data:** [UBX-MGA-ANO](#page-322-1) messages can be used to supply predictions of future orbit information to a u-blox receiver. These messages can be obtained from the AssistNow Offline Service and allow a receiver to improve its TTFF even when it is no longer connected to the internet.
- **Auxiliary information:** Each GNSS transmits some auxiliary data (such as SV health information or UTC parameters) to the receiver. A selection of messages exist for providing such information to the receiver, such as [UBX-MGA-GPS-IONO](#page-341-0) for ionospheric data from GPS.
- **EOP:** Earth Orientation Parameters can be sent to the receiver using the [UBX-MGA-INI-EOP](#page-348-1) message. This will replace the default model used by the AssistNow Autonomous feature and may improve performance (particularly as the receiver gets older and the built-in model decays).
- **Navigation Database:** u-blox receivers can be instructed to dump the current state of their internal navigation database with the [UBX-MGA-DBD-POLL](#page-327-1) message; sending this information back to the receiver (e.g. after a period when the receiver was turned off) restores the database to its former state, and thus allows the receiver to restart rapidly.

## <span id="page-56-1"></span>**12.3 AssistNow Online**

AssistNow Online is u-blox' end-to-end Assisted GNSS (A-GNSS) solution for receivers that have access to the internet. Data supplied by the AssistNow Online Service can be directly uploaded to a u-blox receiver in order to substantially reduce Time To First Fix (TTFF), even under poor signal conditions. The system works by collecting data such as ephemeris and almanac from the satellites through u-blox' Global Reference Network of receivers and providing this data to customers in a convenient form that can be forwarded on directly to u-blox receivers.

The AssistNow Online Service uses a simple, stateless, HTTP interface. Therefore, it works on all standard mobile communication networks that support internet access, including GPRS, UMTS and Wireless LAN. No special arrangements need to be made with mobile network operators to



## enable AssistNow Online.



The data returned by the AssistNow Online Service is a sequence of UBX-MGA messages, starting with an estimate of the current time in the form of a [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) message.

AssistNow Online currently supports GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo, and QZSS.

Customers may choose to use third party sources of assistance data instead of using the AssistNow Online Service. Customers choosing this option will need to ensure that the data is converted from the format used by the third party source to the appropriate MGA messages. However, it is important to ensure that the receiver has an estimate of the current time before it processes any other assistance data. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to send a [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) or [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_GNSS](#page-345-0) as the first message of any assistance.

#### <span id="page-57-0"></span>**12.3.1 Host Software**

As u-blox receivers have no means to connect directly with the internet, the AssistNow Online system can only work if the host system that contains the receiver can connect to the internet, download the data from the AssistNow Online Service and forward it on to the receiver. In the simplest case that may involve fetching the data from the AssistNow Online Service (by means of a single HTTP GET request), and sending the resulting data to the receiver.

Depending on the circumstances, it may be beneficial for the host software to include:

- Creating an appropriate [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) message to deliver a better sense of time to the receiver, especially if the host system has a very good sense of the current time and can deliver a time pulse to one of the receiver's EXTINT pins.
- Enable and use [flow control](#page-58-1) to prevent loss of data due to buffer overflow in the receiver.
- u-blox provides the source code for an example library, called libMGA, that provides all of



the functionality we expect in most host software.

## <span id="page-58-0"></span>**12.3.2 AssistNow Online Sequence**

A typical sequence of use of the AssistNow Online Service comprises the following steps:

- Power-up the u-blox receiver
- Request data from the AssistNow Online Service
- Optionally send [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) followed by hardware time synchronization pulse if hardware time synchronization is required.
- Send the UBX messages obtained from the AssistNow Online Service to the receiver.

#### <span id="page-58-1"></span>**12.3.3 Flow Control**

u-blox receivers aim to process incoming messages as quickly as possible, but there will always be a small delay in processing each message. Uploading assistance data to the receiver can involve sending as many as one hundred individual messages to the receiver, one after the other. If the communication link is fast, and/or the receiver is busy (trying to acquire new signals), it is possible that the internal buffers will overflow and some messages will be lost. In order to combat this, ublox receivers support an optional flow control mechanism for assistance.

Flow control is activated by setting the ackAiding parameter in the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) message.

As a result the receiver will issue an acknowledgement message ([UBX-MGA-ACK](#page-321-0)) for each assistance message it successfully receives. The host software can examine these acknowledgements to establish whether there were any problems with the data sent to the receiver and deduce (by the lack of acknowledgement) if any messages have been lost. It may then be appropriate to resend some of the assistance messages.

The simplest way to implement flow control would be to send one UBX-MGA assistance message at a time, waiting for the acknowledgement, before sending the next. However, such a strategy is likely to introduce significant delays into the whole assistance process. The best strategy will depend on the amount of assistance data being sent and the nature of the communications link (e.g. baud rate of serial link). u-blox recommends that when customers are developing their host software they start by sending all assistance messages and then analyse the resulting acknowledgements to see whether there have been significant losses. Adding small delays during the transmission may be a simple but effective way to avoid substantial loss of data.

#### <span id="page-58-2"></span>**12.3.4 Authorization**

The AssistNow Online Service is only available for use by u-blox customers. In order to use the services, customers will need to obtain an authorization token from u-blox. This token must be supplied as a parameter whenever a request is made to either service.

## <span id="page-58-3"></span>**12.3.5 Service Parameters**

The information exchange with the AssistNow Online Service is based on the HTTP protocol. Upon reception of an HTTP GET request, the server will respond with the required messages in binary format or with an error string in text format. After delivery of all data, the server will terminate the connection.

The HTTP GET request from the client to the server should contain a standard HTTP query string in the request URL. The query string consists of a set of "key=value" parameters in the following form:



key=value;key=value;key=value;

The following rules apply:

- The order of keys is not important.
- Keys and values are case sensitive.
- Keys and values must be separated by an equals character ('=').
- Key/value pairs must be separated by semicolons (';').
- If a value contains a list, each item in the list must be separated by a comma (',').

The following table describes the keys that are supported.

| Key Name    | Unit/Range | Optional | Description                                                           |

|             |            |          | is always returned for each request. If the value of this             |
|             |            |          | parameter is an empty string, only time data will be returned.        |
| lat         | Numeric    | Optional | Approximate user latitude in WGS 84 expressed in degrees              |
|             | [degrees]  |          | and fractional degrees. Must be in range -90 to 90. Example:          |

| lon         | Numeric    | Optional | Approximate user longitude in WGS 84 expressed in degrees             |
|             | [degrees]  |          | and fractional degrees. Must be in range -180 to 180. Example:        |
|             |            |          | lon=8.55.                                                             |
| alt         | Numeric    | Optional | Approximate user altitude above WGS 84 Ellipsoid. If this             |
|             | [meters]   |          | value is not provided, the server assumes an altitude of 0            |
|             |            |          | meters. Must be in range -1000 to 50000.                              |
| pacc        | Numeric    | Optional | Approximate accuracy of submitted position (see position              |
|             | [meters]   |          | parameters note below). If this value is not provided, the            |
|             |            |          | server assumes an accuracy of 300 km. Must be in range 0 to           |
|             |            |          | 6000000.                                                              |

|             |            |          | seconds. Must be in range 0 to 3600.                                  |
| latency     | Numeric    | Optional | Typical latency between the time the server receives the              |
|             | [seconds]  |          | request, and the time when the assistance data arrives at the         |
|             |            |          | u-blox receiver. The server can use this value to correct the         |
|             |            |          | time being transmitted to the client. If this value is not            |
|             |            |          | provided, the server assumes a latency of 0. Must be in range         |
|             |            |          | 0 to 3600.                                                            |
| filteronpos | (no value  | Optional | If present, the ephemeris data returned to the client will only       |
|             | required)  |          | contain data for the satellites which are likely to be visible        |
|             |            |          | from the approximate position provided by the lat, lon, alt and       |

|             |            |          | provided the service will return an error.                            |

## **AssistNow Online Parameter Keys**



AssistNow Online Parameter Keys continued

| Key Name   | Unit/Range | Optional | Description                                                  |
|------------|------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| filteronsv | String     | Optional | A comma separated list of u-blox gnssId:svId pairs. The      |
|            |            |          | ephemeris data returned to the client will only contain data |
|            |            |          | for the listed satellites.                                   |

Thus, as an example, a valid parameter string would be:

token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;gnss=gps,qzss;datatype=eph,pos,aux;lat=47.28;lon=8.56; pacc=1000

## **12.3.5.1 Position parameters (lat, lon, alt and pacc)**

The position parameters (lat, lon, alt and pacc) are used by the server for two purposes:

- If the filteronpos parameter is provided, the server determines the currently visible satellites at the user position, and only sends the ephemeris data of those satellites which should be in view at the location of the user. This reduces bandwidth requirements. In this case the 'pacc' value is taken into account, meaning that the server will return all SVs visible in the given uncertainty region.
- If the datatype 'pos' is requested, the server will return the position and accuracy in the response data. When this data is supplied to the u-blox receiver, depending on the accuracy of the provided data, the receiver can then choose to select a better startup strategy. For example, if the position is accurate to 100 km or better, the u-blox receiver will choose to go for a more optimistic startup strategy. This will result in quicker startup time. The receiver will decide which strategy to choose, depending on the 'pacc' parameter. If the submitted user position is less accurate than what is being specified with the 'pacc' parameter, then the user will experience prolonged or even failed startups.

## **12.3.5.2 Time parameters (tacc and latency)**

Time data is always returned with each request. The time data refers to the time at which the response leaves the server, corrected by an optional latency value. This time data provided by the service is accurate to approximately 10 ms but by default the time accuracy is indicated to be +/- 10 seconds in order to account for network latency and any time between the client receiving the data and it being provided to the receiver.

If both the network latency and the client latency can safely be assumed to be very low (or are known), the client can choose to set the accuracy of the time message (tacc) to a much smaller value (e.g. 0.5 s). This will result in a faster TTFF. The latency can also be adjusted as appropriate. However, these fields should be used with caution: if the time accuracy is not correct when the time data reaches the receiver, the receiver may experience prolonged or even failed start-ups.

For optimal results, the client should establish an accurate sense of time itself (e.g. by calibrating its system clock using a local NTP service) and then modify the time data received from the service as appropriate.

## <span id="page-60-0"></span>**12.3.6 Multiple Servers**

u-blox has designed and implemented the AssistNow Online Service in a way that should provide very high reliability. Nonetheless, there will be rare occasions when a server is not available (e.g. due to failure or some form of maintenance activity). In order to protect customers against the impact of such outages, u-blox will run at least two instances of the AssistNow Online Service on independent machines. Customers will have a free choice of requesting assistance data from any



of these servers, as all will provide the same information. However, should one fail for whatever reason, it is highly unlikely that the other server(s) will also be unavailable. Therefore customers requiring the best possible availability are recommended to implement a scheme where they direct their requests to a chosen server, but, if that server fails to respond, have a fall-back mechanism to use another server instead.

## <span id="page-61-0"></span>**12.4 AssistNow Offline**

AssistNow Offline is a feature that combines special firmware in u-blox receivers and a proprietary service run by u-blox. It is targeted at receivers that only have occasional internet access and so cannot use AssistNow Online. AssistNow Offline speeds up Time To First Fix (TTFF), typically to considerably less than 10 s

AssistNow Offline currently supports GPS and GLONASS. u-blox intends to expand the AssistNow Offline Service to support other GNSS (such as BeiDou and Galileo) in due course.

The AssistNow Offline Service uses a simple, stateless, HTTP interface. Therefore, it works on all standard mobile communication networks that support internet access, including GPRS, UMTS and Wireless LAN. No special arrangements need to be made with mobile network operators to enable AssistNow Offline.

Users of AssistNow Offline are expected to download data from the AssistNow Offline Service, specifying the time period they want covered (1 to 5 weeks) and the types of GNSS. This data must be uploaded to a u-blox receiver, so that it can estimate the positions of the satellites, when no better data is available. Using these estimates will not provide as accurate a position fix as if current ephemeris data is used, but it will allow much faster TTFFs in nearly all cases.

The data obtained from the AssistNow Offline Service is organised by date, normally a day at a time. Consequently the more weeks for which coverage is requested, the larger the amount of data to handle. Similarly, each different GNSS requires its own data and in the extreme cases, several hundred kilobytes of data will be provided by the service. This amount can be reduced by requesting lower resolution, but this will have a small negative impact on both position accuracy and TTFF. See section [Offline Service Parameters](#page-61-1) for details of how to specify these options.

The downloaded Offline data is encoded in a sequence of [UBX-MGA-ANO](#page-322-1) messages, one for every SV for every day of the period covered. Thus, for example, data for all GPS SVs for 4 weeks will involve in excess of 900 separate messages, taking up around 70 kbytes. Where a u-blox receiver has flash storage, all the data can be directly uploaded to be stored in the flash until it is needed. In this case, the receiver will automatically select the most appropriate data to use at any time. See section [flash-based AssistNow Offline](#page-63-0) for further details.

AssistNow Offline can also be used where the receiver has no flash storage, or there is insufficient spare flash memory. In this case the customer's system must store the AssistNow Offline data until the receiver needs it and then upload only the appropriate part for immediate use. See section [host-based AssistNow Offline](#page-64-0) for further details.

## <span id="page-61-1"></span>**12.4.1 Service Parameters**

The information exchange with the AssistNow Offline Service is based on the HTTP protocol. Upon reception of an HTTP GET request, the server will respond with the required messages in binary format or with an error string in text format. After delivery of all data, the server will terminate the connection.

The HTTP GET request from the client to the server should contain a standard HTTP querystring



in the request URL. The querystring consists of a set of "key=value" parameters in the following form:

key=value;key=value;key=value;

The following rules apply:

- The order of keys is not important.
- Keys and values are case sensitive.
- Keys and values must be separated by an equals character ('=').
- Key/value pairs must be separated by semicolons (';').
- If a value contains a list, each item in the list must be separated by a comma (',').

The following table describes the keys that are supported.

| Key Name   | Unit/Range | Optional | Description                                                           |
|------------|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| token      | String     |          | Mandatory The authorization token supplied by u-blox when a client    |
|            |            |          | registers to use the service.                                         |
| gnss       | String     |          | Mandatory A comma separated list of the GNSS for which data should be |
|            |            |          | returned. The currently supported GNSS are: gps and glo.              |
| period     | Numeric    | Optional | The number of weeks into the future the data should be valid          |
|            | [weeks]    |          | for. Data can be requested for up to 5 weeks in to the future. If     |
|            |            |          | this value is not provided, the server assumes a period of 4          |
|            |            |          | weeks.                                                                |
| resolution | Numeric    | Optional | The resolution of the data: 1=every day, 2=every other day,           |
|            | [days]     |          | 3=every third day. If this value is not provided, the server          |
|            |            |          | assumes a resolution of 1 day.                                        |

## **AssistNow Offline Parameter Keys**

Thus, as an example, a valid parameter string would be:

token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX;gnss=gps,glo;

## <span id="page-62-0"></span>**12.4.2 Authorization**

The AssistNow Offline Service uses the same authorization process as AssistNow Online; see [above](#page-58-2) for details.

## <span id="page-62-1"></span>**12.4.3 Multiple Servers**

The AssistNow Offline Service uses the same multiple server mechanism to provide high availability as AssistNow Online; see [above](#page-60-0) for details.

## <span id="page-62-2"></span>**12.4.4 Time, Position and Almanac**

While AssistNow Offline can be used on its own, it is expected that the user will provide estimates of the receiver's current position, the current time and ensure that a reasonably up to date almanac is available. In most cases this information is likely to be available without the user needing to do anything. For example, where the receiver is connected to a battery backup power supply and has a functioning real time clock (RTC), the receiver will keep its own sense of time and will retain the last known position and any almanac. However, should the receiver be completely unpowered before startup, then it will greatly improve TTFF if time, position and almanac can be supplied in some form.

Almanac data has a validity period of several weeks, so it can be downloaded from the AssistNow



Online service at roughly the same time the Offline data is obtained. It can then be stored in the host for uploading on receiver startup, or it can be transferred to the receiver straight away and preserved there (provided suitable non-volatile storage is available).

Obviously, where a receiver has a functioning RTC, it should be able to keep its own sense of time, but where no RTC is fitted (or power is completely turned off), providing a time estimate via the [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) message will be beneficial.

Similarly, where a receiver has effective non-volatile storage, the last known position will be recalled, but if this is not the case, then it will help TTFF to provide a position estimate via one of the [UBX-MGA-INI-POS\\_XYZ](#page-342-1) or [UBX-MGA-INI-POS\\_LLH](#page-343-0) messages.

Where circumstance prevent the provision of all three of these pieces of data, providing some is likely to be better than none at all.

## <span id="page-63-0"></span>**12.4.5 Flash-based AssistNow Offline**

Flash-based AssistNow Offline functionality means that AssistNow Offline data is stored in the flash memory connected to the chip.

The user's host system must download the data from the AssistNow Offline service when an internet connection is available, and then deliver all of that data to the u-blox receiver. As the total amount of data to be uploaded is large (typically around 100 kbytes) and writing to flash memory is slow, the upload must be done in blocks of up to 512 bytes, one at a time. The [UBX-MGA-FLASH-](#page-328-1)[DATA](#page-328-1) message is used to transmit each block to the receiver.

AssistNow Offline data stored in flash memory is not affected by any reset of the receiver. The only simple ways to clear it are to completely erase the whole flash memory or to overwrite it with a new set of AssistNow Offline data. Uploading a dummy block of data (e.g. all zeros) will also have the effect of deleting the data, although a small amount of flash storage will be used.

## **12.4.5.1 Flash-based Storage Procedure**

The following steps are a typical sequence for transferring AssistNow Offline data into the receiver's flash memory:

- The host downloads a copy of a latest data from the AssistNow Offline service and stores it locally.
- It sends the first 512 bytes of that data using the [UBX-MGA-FLASH-DATA](#page-328-1) message.
- It awaits a [UBX-MGA-FLASH-ACK](#page-329-0) message in reply.
- Based on the contents of the [UBX-MGA-FLASH-ACK](#page-329-0) message it, sends the next block, resends the last block or aborts the whole process.
- The above three steps are repeated until all the rest of the data has been successfully transferred (or the process has been aborted).
- The host sends an [UBX-MGA-FLASH-STOP](#page-329-0) message to indicate completion of the upload.
- It awaits the final [UBX-MGA-FLASH-ACK](#page-329-0) message in reply. Background processing in the receiver prepares the downloaded data for use at this stage. Particularly if the receiver is currently busy, this may take quite a few seconds, so the host has to be prepared for a delay before the [UBX-](#page-329-0)[MGA-FLASH-ACK](#page-329-0) is seen.

Note that the final block may be smaller than 512 bytes (where the total data size is not perfectly divisible by 512). Also, the [UBX-MGA-FLASH-ACK](#page-329-0) messages are distinct from the [UBX-MGA-ACK](#page-321-0) messages used for other AssistNow functions.



Any existing data will be deleted as soon as the first block of new data arrives, so no useful data will be available till the completion of the data transfer. Each block of data has a sequence number, starting at zero for the first block. In order to guard against invalid partial data downloads the receiver will not accept blocks which are out of sequence.

## <span id="page-64-0"></span>**12.4.6 Host-based AssistNow Offline**

Host-based AssistNow Offline involves AssistNow Offline data being stored until it is needed by the user's host system in whatever memory it has available.

The user's host system must download the data from the AssistNow Offline service when an internet connection is available, but retain it until the time the u-blox receiver needs it. At this point, the host must upload just the relevant portion of the data to the receiver, so that the receiver can start using it. This is achieved by parsing all the data and selecting for upload to the receiver only those [UBX-MGA-ANO](#page-322-1) messages with a date-stamp nearest the current time. As each is a complete UBX message it can be sent directly to the receiver with no extra packaging. If required the user can select to employ [flow control,](#page-58-1) but in most cases this is likely to prove unnecessary.

When parsing the data obtained from the AssistNow Offline service the following points should be noted:

- The data is made up of a sequence of [UBX-MGA-ANO](#page-322-1) messages.
- Customers should not rely on the messages all being of a fixed size, but should read their length from the UBX header to work out where the message ends (and where the next begins).
- Each message indicates the SV for which it is applicable through the svId and gnssId fields.
- Each message contains a date-stamp within the year, month and day fields.
- Midday (UTC) on the day indicated should be considered to be the point at which the data is most applicable.
- The messages will be ordered chronologically, earliest first.
- Messages with same date-stamp will be ordered by ascending gnssId and then ascending svId.

## **12.4.6.1 Host-based Procedure**

The following steps are a typical sequence for host-based AssistNow Offline:

- The host downloads a copy of the latest data from the AssistNow Offline service and stores it locally.
- Optionally it may also download a current set of almanac data from the AssistNow Online service.
- It waits until it wants to use the u-blox receiver.
- If necessary it uploads any almanac, position estimate and/or time estimate to the receiver.
- The host scans through AssistNow Offline data looking for entries with a date-stamp that most closely matches the current (UTC) time/date.
- The host sends each such [UBX-MGA-ANO](#page-322-1) message to the receiver.

Note that when data has been downloaded from the AssistNow Offline service with the (default) resolution of one day, the means for selecting the closest matching date-stamp is simply to look for ones with the current (UTC) date.



## <span id="page-65-0"></span>**12.5 Preserving Information During Power-off**

The performance of u-blox receivers immediately after they are turned on is enhanced by providing them with as much useful information as possible. Assistance (both [Online](#page-56-1) and [Offline](#page-61-0)) is one way to achieve this, but retaining information from previous use of the receiver can be just as valuable. All the [types of data delivered by assistance](#page-56-0) can be retained while the receiver is powered down for use when power is restored. Obviously the value of this data will diminish as time passes, but in many cases it remains very useful and can significantly improve time to first fix.

The are several ways in which a u-blox receiver can retain useful data while it is powered down, including:

- **Battery Backed RAM:** The receiver can be supplied with sufficient power to maintain a small portion of internal storage, while it is otherwise turned off. This is the best mechanism, provided that the small amount of electrical power required can be supplied continuously.
- **Save on Shutdown:** The receiver can be instructed to dump its current state to the attached flash memory (where fitted) as part of the shutdown procedure; this data is then automatically retrieved when the receiver is restarted. See the description of the UBX-UPD-SOS messages for more information.
- **Database Dump:** The receiver can be asked to dump the state of its internal database in the form of a sequence of UBX messages reported to the host; these messages can be stored by the host and then sent back to the receiver when it has been restarted. See the description of the [UBX-MGA-DBD](#page-327-1) messages for more information.

## <span id="page-65-1"></span>**12.6 AssistNow Autonomous**

(Note: some functionality described in this chapter may not be available in [protocol versions less](#page-15-2) [than 18](#page-15-2)).

## <span id="page-65-2"></span>**12.6.1 Introduction**

The assistance scenarios covered by AssistNow Online and AssistNow Offline require an online connection and a host that can use this connection to download aiding data and provide this to the receiver when required.

The AssistNow Autonomous feature provides a functionality similar to AssistNow Offline without the need for a host and a connection. Based on a broadcast ephemeris downloaded from the satellite (or obtained by AssistNow Online) the receiver can autonomously (i.e. without any host interaction or online connection) generate an accurate satellite orbit representation (Â«AssistNow Autonomous dataÂ») that is usable for navigation much longer than the underlying broadcast ephemeris was intended for. This makes downloading new ephemeris or aiding data for the first fix unnecessary for subsequent start-ups of the receiver.

The AssistNow Autonomous feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled using the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) message.

## <span id="page-65-3"></span>**12.6.2 Concept**

The figure below illustrates the AssistNow Autonomous concept in a graphical way. Note that the figure is a qualitative illustration and is not to scale.

â¢ A broadcast ephemeris downloaded from the satellite is a precise representation of a part (for GPS nominally four hours) of the satellite's true orbit (trajectory). It is not usable for positioning



beyond this validity period because it diverges dramatically from the true orbit afterwards.

- The AssistNow Autonomous orbit is an extension of one or more broadcast ephemerides. It provides a long-term orbit for the satellite for several revolutions. Although this orbit is not perfectly precise it is a sufficiently accurate representation of the true orbit to be used for navigation.
- The AssistNow Autonomous data is automatically and autonomously generated from downloaded (or assisted) ephemerides. The data is stored automatically in the on-chip batterybacked memory (BBR). Optionally, the data can be backed-up in external flash memory or on the host. The number of satellites for which data can be stored depends on the receiver configuration and may change during operation.
- If no broadcast ephemeris is available for navigation AssistNow Autonomous automatically generates the required parts of the orbits suitable for navigation from the stored data. The data is also automatically kept current in order to minimize the calculation time once the navigation engine needs orbits.
- The operation of the AssistNow Autonomous feature is transparent to the user and the operation of the receiver. All calculations are done in background and do not affect the normal operation of the receiver.
- The AssistNow Autonomous subsystem automatically invalidates data that has become too old and that would introduce unacceptable positioning errors. This threshold is configurable (see below).
- The prediction quality will be automatically improved if the satellite has been observed multiple times. However, this requires the availability of a suitable flash memory (see the integration manual for a list of supported devices). Improved prediction quality also positively affects the maximum usability period of the data.
- AssistNow Autonomous considers GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou satellites only. It will not consider satellites on orbits with an eccentricity of >0.05 (e.g., Galileo E18). For GLONASS support a suitable flash memory is mandatory because a single broadcast ephemeris spans to little of the orbit (only approx. 30 minutes) in order to extend it in a usable way. Only multiple observations of the same GLONASS satellite that span at least four hours will be used to generate data.





## <span id="page-67-0"></span>**12.6.3 Interface**

Several UBX protocol messages provide interfaces to the AssistNow Autonomous feature. They are:

- The [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) message is used to enable or disable the AssistNow Autonomous feature. It is disabled by default. Once enabled, the receiver will automatically produce AssistNow Autonomous data for newly received broadcast ephemerides and, if that data is available, automatically provide the navigation subsystem with orbits when necessary and adequate. The message also allows for a configuration of the maximum acceptable orbit error. See the next section for an explanation of this feature. It is recommended to use the firmware default value that corresponds to a default orbit data validity of approximately three days (for GPS satellites observed once) and up to six days (for GPS and GLONASS satellites observed multiple times over a period of at least half a day).
- Note that disabling the AssistNow Autonomous feature will delete all previously collected satellite observation data from the flash memory.
- The [UBX-NAV-AOPSTATUS](#page-371-0) message provides information on the current state of the AssistNow Autonomous subsystem. The status indicates whether the AssistNow Autonomous subsystem is currently idle (or not enabled) or busy generating data or orbits. Hosts should monitor this information and only power-off the receiver when the subsystem is idle (that is, when the status field shows a steady zero).
- The [UBX-NAV-SAT](#page-395-2) message indicates the use of AssistNow Autonomous orbits for individual satellites.



- The [UBX-NAV-ORB](#page-385-1) message indicates the availability of AssistNow Autonomous orbits for individual satellites.
- The [UBX-MGA-DBD](#page-327-1) message provides a means to retrieve the AssistNow Autonomous data from the receiver in order to preserve the data in power-off mode where no battery backup is available. Note that the receiver requires the absolute time (i.e. full date and time) to calculate AssistNow Autonomous orbits. For best performance it is, therefore, recommended to supply this information to the receiver using the [UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\\_UTC](#page-343-0) message in this scenario.
- The [Save-on-Shutdown](#page-25-2) feature preserves AssistNow Autonomous data.

## <span id="page-68-0"></span>**12.6.4 Benefits and Drawbacks**

AssistNow Autonomous can provide quicker start-up times (lower the TTFF) provided that data is available for enough visible satellites. This is particularly true under weak signal conditions where it might not be possible to download broadcast ephemerides at all, and, therefore, no fix at all would be possible without AssistNow Autonomous (or A-GNSS). It is, however, required that the receiver roughly knows the absolute time, either from an RTC or from time-aiding (see the Interface section above), and that it knows which satellites are visible, either from the almanac or from tracking the respective signals.

The AssistNow Autonomous orbit (satellite position) accuracy depends on various factors, such as the particular type of satellite, the accuracy of the underlying broadcast ephemeris, or the orbital phase of the satellite and Earth, and the age of the data (errors add up over time).

AssistNow Autonomous will typically extend a broadcast ephemeris for up to three to six days. The [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) (see above) message allows changing this threshold by setting the Â«maximum acceptable modelled orbit errorÂ» (in meters). Note that this number does not reflect the true orbit error introduced by extending the ephemeris. It is a statistical value that represents a certain expected upper limit based on a number of parameters. A rough approximation that relates the maximum extension time to this setting is: maxError [m] = maxAge [d] \* f, where the factor f is 30 for data derived from satellites seen once and and 16 for data derived for satellites seen multiple times during a long enough time period (see the Concept section above).

There is no direct relation between (true and statistical) orbit accuracy and positioning accuracy. The positioning accuracy depends on various factors, such as the satellite position accuracy, the number of visible satellites, and the geometry (DOP) of the visible satellites. Position fixes that include AssistNow Autonomous orbit information may be significantly worse than fixes using only broadcast ephemerides. It might be necessary to adjust the limits of the [Navigation Output](#page-37-0) [Filters.](#page-37-0)

A fundamental deficiency of any system to predict satellite orbits precisely is unknown future events. Hence, the receiver will not be able to know about satellites that will have become unhealthy, have undergone a clock swap, or have had a manoeuvre. This means that the navigation engine might rarely mistake a wrong satellite position as the true satellite position. However, provided that there are enough other good satellites, the navigation algorithms will eventually eliminate a defective orbit from the navigation solution.

The repeatability of the satellite constellation is a potential pitfall for the use of the AssistNow Autonomous feature. For a given location on Earth the (GPS) constellation (geometry of visible satellites) repeats every 24 hours. Hence, when the receiver Â«learnedÂ» about a number of satellites at some point in time the same satellites will in most places not be visible 12 hours later, and the available AssistNow Autonomous data will not be of any help. Again 12 hours later, however, usable data would be available because it had been generated 24 hours ago.



The longer a receiver observes the sky the more satellites it will have seen. At the equator, and with full sky view, approximately ten (GPS) satellites will show up in a one hour window. After four hours of observation approx. 16 satellites (i.e. half the constellation), after 10 hours approx. 24 satellites (2/3rd of the constellation), and after approx. 16 hours the full constellation will have been observed (and AssistNow Autonomous data generated for). Lower sky visibility reduces these figures. Further away from the equator the numbers improve because the satellites can be seen twice a day. E.g. at 47 degrees north the full constellation can be observed in approx. 12 hours with full sky view.

The calculations required for AssistNow Autonomous are carried out on the receiver. This requires energy and users may therefore occasionally see increased power consumption during short periods (several seconds, rarely more than 60 seconds) when such calculations are running. Ongoing calculations will automatically prevent the [power save mode](#page-69-0) from entering the power-off state. The power-down will be delayed until all calculations are done.

The AssistNow Offline and AssistNow Autonomous features are exclusive and should not be used at the same time. Every satellite will be ignored by AssistNow Autonomous if there is AssistNow Offline data available for it.

## <span id="page-69-0"></span>**13 Power Management**

u-blox receivers support different power modes. These modes represent strategies of how to control the acquisition and tracking engines in order to achieve either the best possible performance or good performance with reduced power consumption.

Receiver power management can split into two categories:

- Externally Controlled Power Management: This includes various modes of power management that are directly operated by the user or host device. These modes are: 1. External cycling of the receiver main power supply. 2. Instruct the receiver to turn On/Off via the [UBX-RXM-PMREQ](#page-421-1) message. 3. Instruct the receiver to turn On/Off via [external pins](#page-80-2) (EXTINT0 or EXTINT1).
- Internally Controlled Power Management: Here the receiver makes the decision when to power down/up some/all of its internal components according to predefined parameters. It is also referred to as Power Save Modes (PSM). In PSM one of three modes of operations can be selected (not all are supported in a single firmware): 1. ON/OFF Operation ([PSMOO](#page-73-0)) 2. Cyclic Tracking ([PSMCT\)](#page-73-1) 3. Super-Efficient Mode ([Super-E](#page-74-0)).

The following figure illustrates u-blox power management modes.



## **u-blox Power Management**



The majority of the Power Management section is detailing the Power Save Mode (Internally Controlled Power Management). However, some the concepts relevant to the Externally Controlled Power Management are detailed, such as the [EXTINT Control](#page-80-2), [Wake up](#page-78-1) and [Power](#page-80-1) [On/Off Command.](#page-80-1)

Externally controlled power management operations can be used on top of the Internally Controlled Power Management and they do override their operation.

## <span id="page-70-0"></span>**13.1 Continuous Mode**

u-blox receivers make use of dedicated signal processing engines optimized for signal acquisition and tracking. The acquisition engine delivers rapid signal searches during cold starts or when insufficient signals are available for navigation. The tracking engine delivers signal measurements for navigation and acquires new signals as they become available during navigation. The resources of both engines are deployed adaptively to minimize overall power consumption.

## <span id="page-70-1"></span>**13.2 Power Save Mode**

Power Save Mode (PSM) allows a reduction in system power consumption by selectively switching parts of the receiver on and off. It is selected using the message [UBX-CFG-RXM](#page-272-1) and configured using [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1). It is recommended to use [UBX-CFG-PMS](#page-256-1) instead if available (only supported in [protocol versions 18+](#page-15-2)) as it provides a simplified interface; see section [Power mode setup](#page-80-4) for details.

PSM is designed to only support the operation of GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo and QZSS. Enabling SBAS or IMES is possible only if at least one of the other systems is enabled. The PSM state machine behavior will not be altered by enabling SBAS or IMES and it will not take them into account in operation. Therefore, it is recommended to disable them (i.e., SBAS or IMES) when operating in Power Save Mode. They can be disabled using [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1).

The logic within Power Save Mode is designed so that [Time Pulse](#page-85-3) operation is not compromised. This means that entering all power saving states is delayed until the conditions necessary to produce a Time Pulse have been met. Therefore, in order to obtain good Power Save Mode operation, it is essential that any Time Pulse is correctly



configured with an appropriate time base, or that Time Pulses are turned off if not needed (by clearing the active flag in [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1)).

- For [protocol versions less than 18](#page-15-2): Power Save Mode can only be selected with GPS signals. Other GNSS are not supported.
- Note: Power Save Mode is not supported in conjunction with the ADR, UDR and FTS products.

## <span id="page-71-0"></span>**13.2.1 Operation**

## Power Save Mode has two modes of operation:

- Power Save Mode Cyclic Tracking (PSMCT) Operation is used when position fixes are required in short periods of 1 to 10s. In receivers that support Super-E Mode, Super-E replaces Cyclic Tracking.
- Power Save Mode ON/OFF (PSMOO) Operation is used for periods longer than 10s, and can be in the order of minutes, hours or days. (Not supported in [protocol versions 23 to 23.01\)](#page-15-2)

The mode of operation can be configured, and depending on the setting, the receiver demonstrates different behavior: In ON/OFF operation the receiver switches between phases of start-up/navigation and phases with low or almost no system activity (backup/sleep). In cyclic tracking the receiver does not shut down completely between fixes, but uses low power tracking instead.

Currently PSMCT is restricted to update period between 1 and 10 seconds and PSMOO is restricted to update period over 10 seconds. However, this may change in future firmware releases.

PSM is based on a state machine with five different states: (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix and (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search states, Acquisition state, Tracking state and Power Optimized Tracking (POT) state.

- Inactive states: Most parts of the receiver are switched off.
- Acquisition state: The receiver actively searches for and acquires signals. Maximum power consumption.
- Tracking state: The receiver continuously tracks and downloads data. Less power consumption than in Acquisition state.
- POT state: The receiver repeatedly loops through a sequence of tracking (Track), calculating the position fix (Fix), and entering an idle period (Idle). No new signals are acquired and no data is downloaded. Much less power consumption than in Tracking state.

The following figure illustrates the PSM state machine:





## <span id="page-72-0"></span>**13.2.1.1 Acquisition Timeout Logic**

The receiver has internal, external and user-configurable mechanisms that determine the time to be spent in acquisition state. This logic is put in place to ensure good performance and low power consumption in different environments and scenarios. This collective logic is referred to as Acquisition Timeout.

Internal mechanisms:

- If the receiver is able to acquire weak signals but not of the quality needed to get a fix, it will transition to (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state after the timeout configured in maxStartupStateDur or earlier if too few signals are acquired.
- If the receiver is unable to acquire any signals or it acquires a small number of extremely bad signals (e.g., no sky view), it will transition to (Inactive) Awaiting Next search state after 15 seconds or the timeout configured in maxStartupStateDur if shorter.

## User-configurable mechanisms:

- minAcqTime is the minimum time that the receiver will spend in Acquisition state (see [minAcqTime](#page-76-0) for details.)
- maxStartupStateDur is the maximum time that the receiver will spend in Acquisition state (see



[maxStartupStateDur](#page-76-1) for details).

â¢ doNotEnterOff forces the receiver to stay awake and in Acquisition state even when a fix is not possible (see [doNotEnterOff](#page-77-0) for details).

External mechanisms:

â¢ The receiver will be forced to stay awake if extintWake is enabled and the configured EXTINT pin is set to "high" and it will be forced to stay in (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search/Fix states if extintBackup is enabled and the configured EXTINT pin is set to "low" (see [EXTINT pin control](#page-77-1) for details).

## <span id="page-73-0"></span>**13.2.1.2 ON/OFF operation - long update period**

#### (Not supported in [protocol versions 23 to 23.01\)](#page-15-2).

When the receiver is switched on, it first enters Acquisition state. If it is able to obtain a valid position fix within the time given by the [Acquisition Timeout,](#page-72-0) it switches to Tracking state. Otherwise it enters (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state and re-starts after the configured search period (minus a start-up margin). As soon as the receiver gets a valid position fix (one passing the [navigation output filters](#page-37-0)), it enters Tracking state. Upon entering Tracking state, the [onTime](#page-76-2) starts. Once the onTime is over, (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state is entered and the receiver re-starts according to the configured update grid (see section [Grid offset](#page-77-2) for an explanation). If the signal is lost while in Tracking state, Acquisition state is entered. If the signal is not found within the acquisition timeout, the receiver enters (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state. Otherwise the receiver will re-enter Tracking state and stay there until the newly started onTime is over.

The diagram below illustrates how ON/OFF operation works:



## **Diagram of ON/OFF operation**

## <span id="page-73-1"></span>**13.2.1.3 Cyclic tracking operation - short update period**

When the receiver is switched on, it first enters Acquisition state. If it is able to obtain a position fix within the time given by the acquisition timeout, it switches to Tracking state. Otherwise, it will enter (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state and re-start within the configured search grid. After a valid position fix, Tracking state is entered and the onTime starts. In other words the onTime starts with the first valid position fix. Once the onTime is over, POT state is entered. In POT state the receiver continues to output position fixes according to the updatePeriod. To have maximum power savings, set the onTime to zero. This causes the receiver to enter POT state as soon as possible. If the signal becomes weak or is lost during POT state, Tracking state is entered. Once the signal is good again and the newly started onTime is over, the receiver will re-enter POT state. If the receiver can't get a position fix in the Tracking state, it enters Acquisition state. Should the acquisition fail as well, (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state is entered. If doNotEnterOff is



enabled and no fix is possible, the receiver will remain in Acquisition state until a fix is possible and it will never enter (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state.

The diagram below illustrates how cyclic tracking operation works:

## **Diagram of cyclic tracking operation**



## <span id="page-74-0"></span>**13.2.1.4 Super-Efficient Mode**

## (Not supported in [protocol versions less than 23](#page-15-2)).

Super-Efficient (Super-E) Mode is a power efficient mode of operation that replaces and improves on [cyclic tracking Power Save Mode \(PSMCT\).](#page-73-1) It uses improved clocking techiques to reduce power consumption and more sophisticated decision making for switching between "Acquisition", "Tracking" and "Power Optimized Tracking" states. This mode was developed and optimized to provide a good compromise between power efficiency and positioning accuracy in wearable applications.

## **13.2.1.5 User controlled operation - update and search period of zero**

Setting the updatePeriod to zero causes the receiver to wait in the (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state until woken up by the user. Setting the search period to zero causes the receiver to wait in the (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state indefinitely after an unsuccessful start-up. Any wake-up event will re-start the receiver. See section [Wake up](#page-78-1) for more information on wake-up events.

External wake-up is required when setting update or search period to zero.

## <span id="page-74-1"></span>**13.2.1.6 Satellite data download**

The receiver is not able to download satellite data (e.g. the ephemeris) while it is working in ON/OFF or cyclic tracking operation. Therefore it has to temporarily switch to continuous operation for the time the satellites transmit the desired data. To save power the receiver schedules the downloads according to an internal timetable and only switches to continuous operation while data of interest is being transmitted by the satellites.

Each SV transmits its own ephemeris data. Ephemeris data download is feasible when the corresponding satellite has been tracked with a sufficient C/No over a certain period of time. The download is scheduled in a 30 minute grid or immediately when fewer than a certain number of visible satellites have valid ephemeris data.

Almanac, ionosphere, UTC correction and SV health data are transmitted by all SVs simultaneously. Therefore these parameters can be downloaded when a single SV is tracked with a high enough C/No.

Allowing more ephemerides to be downloaded before going into POT or (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state can help improve the quality of the fixes and reduce the number of wake ups needed to



download ephemerides at the cost of extra time in Acquisition state (only when an inadequate number of ephemerides are downloaded from tracked satellites).

## <span id="page-75-0"></span>**13.2.2 Configuration**

Power Save Mode is enabled and disabled with the [UBX-CFG-RXM](#page-272-1) message and configured with the [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1) message.

When enabling Power Save Mode, the receiver will be unable to download or process any SBAS or IMES data. Therefore, there is no benefit in enabling them and it is recommended to disable both systems. SBAS support and IMES support can be disabled using [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1).

A number of parameters can be used to customize PSM to any specific needs. These parameters are listed in the following table:

## **Power Save Mode configuration options on UBX-CFG-PM2**

| Parameter          | Description                                                                   |

#### <span id="page-75-2"></span>**13.2.2.1 Mode of operation (mode)**

The mode of operation to use mainly depends on the update period: For short update periods (in the range of a few seconds), cyclic tracking should be configured. For long update periods (in the range of minutes or longer), only use ON/OFF operation.

See section [ON/OFF operation - long update period](#page-73-0) and [Cyclic tracking operation - short update](#page-73-1) [period](#page-73-1) for more information on the two modes of operation.

## <span id="page-75-1"></span>**13.2.2.2 Reference Time Standard**

In older versions ( in [protocol versions less than 18\)](#page-15-2), only GPS can be configured for PSM, therefore, GPS time standard is used for the operation of PSM. Whereas, in newer versions where multiple GNSS can operate simultaneously ( in [protocol versions 18+](#page-15-2)), UTC time standard is used.



## <span id="page-76-3"></span>**13.2.2.3 Update period (updatePeriod) and search period (searchPeriod)**

The update period specifies the time between successive position fixes. If no position fix can be obtained within the acquisition timeout, the receiver will retry after the time specified by the search period. Update and search periods are fixed with respect to an absolute time grid based on reference time standard (i.e., GPS Time or UTC. see [Reference Time Standard](#page-75-1)). They do not refer to the time of the last valid position fix or last position fix attempt.

New settings are ignored if the update period or the search period exceeds the maximum number of milliseconds in a week. In that case the previously stored values remain effective.

#### <span id="page-76-0"></span>**13.2.2.4 Minimum Acquisition Time (minAcqTime)**

The receiver tries to obtain a position fix for at least the time given in minAcqTime. If the receiver determines that it needs more time for the given starting conditions then it will automatically prolong this time. If minAcqTime is set to zero then the minimum acquisition time is exclusively determined by the receiver. Once the minAcqTime has expired, the receiver will terminate the acquisition state if either a fix is achieved or if the receiver estimates that any signals received are insufficient (too weak or too few) for a fix to be possible.

## <span id="page-76-2"></span>**13.2.2.5 On time (onTime)**

The onTime parameter specifies how long the receiver stays in Tracking state before switching to the POT state (in PSMCT) or (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state (in PSMOO).

#### <span id="page-76-4"></span>**13.2.2.6 Wait for time fix (waitTimeFix)**

A time fix is a fix type in which the receiver will ensure that the time is accurate and confirmed to within the limits set in [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1). Enabling the waitTimeFix option will force the receiver to stay in Acquisition state until the time is known to within the configured limits then it will transition to Tracking state. Enabling waitTimeFix will delay the transition from Acquisition state to Tracking state by at least two extra seconds, thus, this should be taken into account (see [Acquisition Timeout](#page-72-0)). It is necessary to enable waitTimeFix in timing products.

The quality of the position fixes can also be configured by setting the limits in the message [UBX-](#page-230-1)[CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1). Setting harder limits in [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1) will typically prolong the time in Acquisition state. Thus, ensuring sufficient time is given to the receiver at start-up (when externally controlled) is necessary (see [Acquisition Timeout Logic\)](#page-72-0). When internally controlled, the receiver can make good judgement on the time needed in Acquisition state and no further adjustments will be needed.

## <span id="page-76-1"></span>**13.2.2.7 Maximum Startup State Duration (maxStartupStateDur)**

#### (Only supported in [protocol versions 17+\)](#page-15-2).

The maxStartupStateDur is the maximum time that the receiver will spend in Startup state (i.e., Acquisition state). If the receiver is unable to acquire a valid position fix within this maximum time, it will transition to (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state (if doNotEnterOff is disabled). Subsequently, the receiver will attempt to acquire another position fix according to the search period (see [Update period \(updatePeriod\) and search period \(searchPeriod\)\)](#page-76-3). If

maxStartupStateDur is set to zero, the receiver will autonomously determine the maximum time to spend in Acquisition state. Note that shorter settings (below about 45s) will degrade an unaided receiver's ability to collect new Ephemeris data at low signal levels (see section [Satellite](#page-74-1)



## [data download](#page-74-1)).

## <span id="page-77-0"></span>**13.2.2.8 Do not enter '(Inactive) Awaiting Next Search' state when no fix (doNotEnterOff)**

If this option is enabled, the receiver acts differently in case it cannot get a fix: instead of entering (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state, it keeps attempting to acquire a position fix. In other words, the receiver will never be in (Inactive) Awaiting Next Search state and therefore searchPeriod and minAcqTime will be ignored.

## <span id="page-77-3"></span>**13.2.2.9 Update RTC (updateRTC) and Ephemeris (updateEPH)**

To maintain the ability of a fast start-up, the receiver needs to calibrate its RTC and update its ephemeris data on a regular basis. This can be ensured by activating the update RTC and update Ephemeris option. The RTC is calibrated every 5 minutes and the ephemeris data is updated approximately every 30 minutes. See section [Satellite data download](#page-74-1) for more information.

## <span id="page-77-1"></span>**13.2.2.10 EXTINT pin control**

The operation of PSM can be externally controlled using either EXTINT0 or EXTINT1 pin. This external control allows the user to decide when to wake up the receiver to obtain a fix and when to force the receiver into sleep/backup mode to save power. Operating the receiver externally through the EXTINT pins will override internal functions that coincide with that specific operation. The choice of which pin to use can be configured through the extintSelect feature in [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1). Only one pin can be selected at a time but it is sufficient to perform all the required tasks.

If the Force-ON (extintWake) feature in [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1) is enabled, the receiver will not enter Inactive states for as long as the configured EXTINT pin (EXTINT0 or EXTINT1) is at 'high' level. The receiver will therefore always be in Acquisition/Tracking state in PSMOO or in Acquisition/Tracking/POT state in PSMCT. When the pin level changes to 'low' the receiver will continue with its configured behavior.

If the Force-OFF (extintBackup) feature in [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1) is enabled, the receiver will enter Inactive states for as long as the configured EXTINT pin is set to 'low' until the next wake up event. Any wake-up event can wake up the receiver even while the EXTINT pin is set to 'low' (see [Wake up\)](#page-78-1). However, if the pin stays at 'low' state, the receiver will only wake up for the time needed to read the configuration pin settings then it will enter the Inactive state again.

If both Force-ON and Force-OFF features are enabled at the same time, the receiver PSM operation will be completely in user control. Setting 'high' on the configured EXTINT pin will wake up the receiver to get a position fix and setting 'low' will put the receiver into sleep/backup mode.

## <span id="page-77-2"></span>**13.2.2.11 Grid offset (gridOffset)**

Once the receiver has a valid time, the update grid is aligned to the start of the week of the [reference time standard](#page-75-1) (midnight between Saturday and Sunday). Before having a valid time, the update grid is unaligned. A grid offset shifts the update grid with respect to the start of the week of the [reference time standard.](#page-75-1) An example of usage can be found in section [Use grid offset](#page-79-1).

The grid offset is not used in cyclic tracking operation.



## **13.2.2.12 Optimization target**

In cyclic tracking operation, the behavior of the receiver can be tuned even more closely to the application's need by choosing an appropriate optimization target.

In protocol version 23.01 two optimization targets are available:

- Performance: The receiver achieves a good GNSS performance while keeping the power consumption low.
- Power save: The receiver might sacrifice GNSS performance in favor of a reduced power consumption.

## <span id="page-78-0"></span>**13.2.3 Features**

#### **13.2.3.1 Communication**

When PSM is enabled, communication with the receiver (e.g. UBX message to disable PSM) requires particular attention. This is because the receiver may be in Inactive state and therefore unable to receive any message through its interfaces. To ensure that the configuration messages are processed by the receiver, even while in Inactive state, the following steps need to be taken:

- Send a dummy sequence of 0xFF (one byte is sufficient) to the receiver's UART interface. This will wake up the receiver if it is in Inactive state. If the receiver is not in Inactive state, the sequence will be ignored.
- Send the configuration message about half a second after the dummy sequence. If the interval between the dummy sequence and the configuration message is too short, the receiver may not yet be ready. If the interval is too long, the receiver may return to Inactive state before the configuration message was received. It is therefore important to check for a [UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) reply from the receiver to confirm that the configuration message was received.
- Send the configuration save message immediately after the configuration message.

Similarly, when configuring the receiver for PSMOO (and PSMCT when doNotEnterOff is disabled), ensure that the configurations are saved. If they are not saved the receiver will enter backup mode and when it wakes up again, it would have lost the configurations and even forgets it was in power save mode. This can be avoided by using the [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) message (see [Receiver Configuration](#page-23-1) for details). When operating PSM from u-center and setting the receiver to Power Save Mode in [UBX-CFG-RXM](#page-272-1), check the save configuration box. u-center will then send a [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) message after the [UBX-CFG-RXM](#page-272-1) to save the configurations.

#### <span id="page-78-1"></span>**13.2.3.2 Wake up**

The receiver can be woken up by generating an edge on one of the following pins:

- rising or falling edge on one of the EXTINT pins
- rising or falling edge on the RXD1 pin
- rising or falling edge on the SPI CS pin
- rising edge on NRESET pin

All wake-up signals are interpreted as a position request, where the receiver wakes up and tries to obtain a position fix. Wake-up signals have no effect if the receiver is already in Acquisition, Tracking or POT state.



## **13.2.3.3 Behavior while USB host connected**

As long as the receiver is connected to a USB host, it will not enter the lowest possible power state. This is because it must retain a small level of CPU activity to avoid breaching requirements of the USB specification. The drawback, however, is that power consumption is higher.

Wake up by pin/UART is possible even if the receiver is connected to a USB host. In this case the state of the pin must be changed for a duration longer than one millisecond.

## **13.2.3.4 Cooperation with the AssistNow Autonomous feature**

If both PSM and [AssistNow Autonomous](#page-65-1) features are enabled, the receiver will not enter (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state as long as AssistNow Autonomous carries out calculations. This prevents losing data from unfinished calculations and, in the end, reduces the total extra power needed for AssistNow Autonomous. The delay before entering (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state, if any, will be in the range of several seconds, rarely more than 20 seconds.

Only entering (Inactive) Awaiting Next Fix state is affected by AssistNow Autonomous. In other words: in cyclic tracking operation, AssistNow Autonomous will not interfere with the PSM (apart from the increased power consumption).

Enabling the AssistNow Autonomous feature will lead to increased power consumption while prediction is calculated. The main goal of PSM is to reduce the overall power consumption. Therefore for each application special care must be taken to judge whether AssistNow Autonomous is beneficial to the overall power consumption or not.

## <span id="page-79-0"></span>**13.2.4 Examples**

#### <span id="page-79-1"></span>**13.2.4.1 Use Grid Offset**

Scenario: Get a position fix once a day at a fixed time. If the position fix cannot be obtained try again every two hours.

Solution: First set the update period to 24x3600s and the search period to 2x3600s. Now a position fix is obtained every 24 hours and if the position fix fails retrials are scheduled in two hour intervals. As the update grid is aligned to midnight Saturday/Sunday [reference time standard](#page-75-1), the position fixes happen at midnight [reference time standard.](#page-75-1) By setting the grid offset to 12x3600s the position fixes are shifted to once a day at noon [reference time standard.](#page-75-1) If the position fix at noon fails, retrials take place every two hours, the first at 14:00 [reference time standard.](#page-75-1) Upon successfully acquiring a position fix the next fix attempt is scheduled for noon the following day.

### **13.2.4.2 User controlled position fix**

Scenario: Get a position fix on request.

Solution: Set updatePeriod and searchPeriod to zero. Set extintSelect to the desired EXTINT pin to be used. Enable the extintWake and extintBackup features.

#### **13.2.4.3 Use update periods of 30 minutes**

Scenario: Get a position fix once every 30 minutes and acquire a fix needed for timing products. Solution: Set mode of operation to PSMOO. Set updatePeriod to 1800 seconds. Set the search period to 120 seconds. Enable waitTimeFix feature.



## <span id="page-80-0"></span>**13.3 Peak current settings**

The peak current during acquisition can be reduced by activating the corresponding option in [UBX-](#page-249-1)[CFG-PM2](#page-249-1). A peak current reduction will result in longer start-up times of the receiver.

This setting is independent of the activated mode (Continuous or Power Save Mode).

## <span id="page-80-1"></span>**13.4 Power On/Off command**

With message [UBX-RXM-PMREQ](#page-421-1) the receiver can be forced to enter Inactive state (in Continuous and Power Save Mode). It will stay in Inactive state for the time specified in the message or until it is woken up by an EXTINT or activity on the RXD1, SPI CS, or NRESET pin.

Sending the message [UBX-RXM-PMREQ](#page-421-1) while the receiver is in Power Save Mode will overrule PSM and force the receiver to enter Inactive state. It will stay in Inactive state until woken up. After wake-up the receiver continues working in Power Save Mode as configured.

## <span id="page-80-2"></span>**13.5 EXTINT pin control when Power Save Mode is not active**

The receiver can be forced OFF also when the Power Save Mode is not active. This works the same way as [EXTINT pin control in Power Save Mode.](#page-77-1) Just as in Power Save Mode, this feature has to be enabled and configured using [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1)

## <span id="page-80-3"></span>**13.6 Measurement and navigation rate with Power Save Mode**

In Continuous Mode, measurement and navigation rate is configured using [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1). In Power Save Mode however, measurement and navigation rate can differ from the configured rates as follows:

- **Cyclic Operation:** When in state Power Optimized Tracking, the measurement and navigation rate is determined by the updatePeriod configured in [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1). The receiver can however switch to Tracking state (e.g. to download data). When in Tracking state, the measurement and navigation rate is as configured with [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1). Note: When the receiver is no longer able to produce position fixes, it can switch from Cyclic Operation to ON/OFF Operation (if this is not disabled with the doNotEnterOff switch in [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1)). In that case the remarks below are relevant.
- **ON/OFF Operation:** ( in [protocol versions less than 18](#page-15-2)) when in state Acquisition, the measurement and navigation rate is **fixed to 2 Hz**. All NMEA (and UBX) messages that are output upon a navigation fix are also output with a rate of 2 Hz. This must be considered when choosing the baud rate of a receiver that uses Power Save Mode! Note that a receiver might stay in Acquisition state for quite some time (can be tens of seconds under weak signal conditions). When the receiver eventually switches to Tracking state, the measurement and navigation rate will be as configured with [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1). However, ( in [protocol versions 18+\)](#page-15-2) the measurement and navigation rate will be as configured with [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1) in all active states.

## <span id="page-80-4"></span>**13.7 Power mode setup**

## (Not supported in [protocol versions less than 18](#page-15-2)).

In order to simplify the power saving configuration of the receiver in typical circumstances, a set of predefined setups can be selected using the message [UBX-CFG-PMS](#page-256-1).



Selecting one of the available setups (listed below) is the equivalent of using a combination of the configuration messages with appropriate parameters that impact the power consumption of the receiver.

| Setup Name      | Description                                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full Power      | No compromises on power saves                                         |
| Balanced        | Power savings without performance degradation                         |
| Aggressive 1 Hz | Best power saving setup (1 Hz rate). This corresponds to Super-E mode |
|                 | performance setting.                                                  |
| Aggressive 2 Hz | Excellent power saving setup (2 Hz rate)                              |
| Aggressive 4 Hz | Good power saving setup (4 Hz rate)                                   |
| Interval        | ON OFF mode setup                                                     |

## **Valid power mode setup in UBX-CFG-PMS**

u-blox recommends using these predefined settings, except where users have very specific power saving requirements.

Note that polling UBX-CFG-PMS will return the setup only if the full configuration is consistent with one of the predefined power mode setups.

- In 4 Hz mode, when running a flash firmware, it is recommended to run with a subset of GNSS systems, to avoid system overload.
- Using UBX-CFG-PMS to set Super-E mode to 1, 2 or 4 Hz navigation rates sets minAcqTime to 180 s instead the default 300 s in [protocol version 23.01](#page-15-2). 300 s is recommended for the best performance.

## <span id="page-81-0"></span>**14 Forcing a Receiver Reset**

Typically, in GNSS receivers, one distinguishes between cold, warm, and hot starts, depending on the type of valid information the receiver has at the time of the restart.

- **Cold start** In cold start mode, the receiver has **no** information from the last position (e.g. time, velocity, frequency etc.) at startup. Therefore, the receiver must search the full time and frequency space, and all possible satellite numbers. If a satellite signal is found, it is tracked to decode the ephemeris (18-36 seconds under strong signal conditions), whereas the other channels continue to search satellites. Once there is a sufficient number of satellites with valid ephemeris, the receiver can calculate position and velocity data. Other GNSS receiver manufacturers call this startup mode Factory Startup.
- **Warm start** In warm start mode, the receiver has approximate information for time, position, and coarse satellite position data (Almanac). In this mode, after power-up, the receiver normally needs to download ephemeris before it can calculate position and velocity data. As the ephemeris data usually is outdated after 4 hours, the receiver will typically start with a Warm start if it has been powered down for more than 4 hours. In this scenario, several augmentations are possible. See section [Multi-GNSS assistance](#page-55-1).
- **Hot start** In hot start mode, the receiver was powered down only for a short time (4 hours or less), so that its ephemeris is still valid. Since the receiver does not need to download ephemeris again, this is the fastest startup method.

In the [UBX-CFG-RST](#page-270-1) message, one can force the receiver to reset and clear data, in order to see the effects of maintaining/losing such data between restarts. For this, the CFG-RST message offers the navBbrMask field, where hot, warm and cold starts can be initiated, and also other



## combinations thereof.

Data stored in flash memory is not cleared by any of the options provided by UBX-CFG-RST. So, for example, if valid AssistNow Offline data stored in the flash it is likely to have an impact on the cold start.

The Reset Type can also be specified. This is not related to GNSS, but to the way the software restarts the system.

- **Hardware Reset** uses the on-chip Watchdog to electrically reset the chip. This is an immediate, asynchronous reset. No Stop events are generated. This is equivalent to pulling the Reset signal of the receiver to ground. This reset reloads the receiver configuration.
- **Controlled Software Reset** terminates all running processes in an orderly manner and, once the system is idle, restarts operation, reloads its configuration and starts to acquire and track GNSS satellites.
- **Controlled Software Reset (GNSS only)** only restarts the GNSS tasks, without reinitializing the full system or reloading any stored configuration.
- **Controlled GNSS Stop** stops all GNSS tasks. The receiver will not be restarted, but will stop any GNSS related processing.
- **Controlled GNSS Start** starts all GNSS tasks.

A reset may reload the receiver configuration. Use [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) to save runtime configuration changes to BBR before the reset.

## <span id="page-82-0"></span>**15 Receiver Status Monitoring**

Messages in the UBX class [UBX-MON](#page-352-0) are used to report the status of the parts of the embedded computer system that are not GNSS specific.

The main purposes are

- Hardware and Software Versions, using [UBX-MON-VER](#page-369-1). See also the chapter [decoding the output](#page-20-0) [of UBX-MON-VER](#page-20-0)
- Status of the Communications Input/Output system
- Status of various Hardware Sections with [UBX-MON-HW](#page-356-1)

## <span id="page-82-1"></span>**15.1 Input/Output system**

The I/O system is a GNSS-internal layer where all data input- and output capabilities (such as UART, DDC, SPI, USB) of the GNSS receiver are combined. Each communications task has buffers assigned, where data is queued. For data originating at the receiver, to be communicated over one or multiple communications queues, the message [UBX-MON-TXBUF](#page-368-1) can be used. This message shows the current and maximum buffer usage, as well as error conditions.

If the amount of data configured is too much for a certain port's bandwidth (e.g. all UBX messages output on a UART port with a baud rate of 9600), the buffer will fill up. Once the buffer space is exceeded, new messages to be sent will be dropped. For details see section [Serial Communication Ports Description](#page-49-0).

Inbound data to the GNSS receiver is placed in buffers. Usage of these buffers is shown with the message [UBX-MON-RXBUF](#page-360-2). Further, as data is then decoded within the receiver (e.g. to separate UBX and NMEA data), the [UBX-MON-MSGPP](#page-358-2) can be used. This message shows (for each port and protocol) how many messages were successfully received. It also shows (for each port) how many bytes were discarded because they were not in any of the supported protocol framings.



The following table shows the port numbers used. Note that any numbers not listed are reserved for future use.

## **Port Number assignment**

| Port # | Electrical Interface |
|--------|----------------------|
| 0      | DDC (I2C compatible) |
| 1      | UART 1               |
| 3      | USB                  |
| 4      | SPI                  |

Protocol numbers range from 0-7. All numbers not listed are reserved.

## **Protocol Number assignment**

## <span id="page-83-0"></span>**15.2 Jamming/Interference Indicator**

The field jamInd of the [UBX-MON-HW](#page-356-1) message can be used as an indicator for continuous wave (narrowband) jammers/interference only. The interpretation of the value depends on the application. It is necessary to run the receiver in an unjammed environment to determine an appropriate value for the unjammed case. If the value rises significantly above this threshold, this indicates that a continuous wave jammer is present.

This indicator is always enabled.

The indicator is reporting any currently detected narrowband interference over all currently configured signal bands

## <span id="page-83-1"></span>**15.3 Jamming/Interference Monitor (ITFM)**

The field jammingState of the [UBX-MON-HW](#page-356-1) message can be used as an indicator for both broadband and continuous wave (CW) jammers/interference. It is independent of the (CW only) jamming indicator described in [Jamming/Interference Indicator](#page-83-0) above.

This monitor reports whether jamming has been detected or suspected by the receiver. The receiver monitors the background noise and looks for significant changes. Normally, with no interference detected, it will report 'OK'. If the receiver detects that the noise has risen above a preset threshold, the receiver reports 'Warning'. If in addition, there is no current valid fix, the receiver reports 'Critical'.

The monitor has four states as shown in the following table:

| Value | Reported | Description                                             |
|-------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
|       | state    |                                                         |

## **Jamming/Interference monitor reported states**



Jamming/Interference monitor reported states continued

| Value | Reported | Description                                                 |
|-------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
|       | state    |                                                             |

|       |          | the thresholds); interference is probable reason why        |
|       |          | there is no fix                                             |

The monitor is disabled by default. The monitor is enabled by sending an appropriate [UBX-CFG-](#page-226-1)[ITFM](#page-226-1) message with the enable bit set. In this message it is also possible to specify the thresholds at which broadband and CW jamming are reported. These thresholds should be interpreted as the dB level above 'normal'. It is also possible to specify whether the receiver expects an active or passive antenna.

- The monitor algorithm relies on comparing the currently measured spectrum with a reference from when a good fix was obtained. Thus the monitor will only function when the receiver has had at least one (good) first fix, and will report 'Unknown' before this time.
- Jamming/Interference monitor is not supported in power save mode (PSM) ON/OFF mode.

The monitor is reporting any currently detected interference over all currently configured signal bands.

## <span id="page-84-0"></span>**16 Spoofing Detection**

(Note: this feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 18\)](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-84-1"></span>**16.1 Introduction**

Spoofing is the process whereby someone tries to forge a GNSS signal with the intention of fooling the receiver into calculating a different user position than the true one.

The spoofing detection feature monitors the GNSS signals for suspicious patterns indicating that the receiver is being spoofed. A flag in [UBX-NAV-STATUS](#page-402-1) alerts the user to potential spoofing.

## <span id="page-84-2"></span>**16.2 Scope**

The spoofing detection feature monitors suspicious changes in the GNSS signal indicating external manipulation. Therefore the detection is only successful when the signal is genuine first and when the transition to the spoofed signal is being observed directly. When a receiver is started up to a spoofed signal the detection algorithms will be unable to recognize the spoofing. Also, the algorithms rely on availability of signals from multiple GNSS; the detection does not work in single GNSS mode.

## <span id="page-84-3"></span>**17 Signal Attenuation Compensation**

(not supported in [protocol versions less than 19\)](#page-15-2).

In normal operating conditions, low signal strength indicates likely contamination by multipath. The receiver trusts such signals less in order to preserve the quality of the position solution in poor signal environments. This feature can result in degraded performance in situations where the signals are attenuated for another reason, for example due to antenna placement. In this case, the signal attenuation compensation feature can be used to restore normal performance.



There are three possible modes:

- Disabled: no signal attenuation compensation is performed
- Automatic: the receiver automatically estimates and compensates for the signal attenuation
- Configured: the receiver compensates for the signal attenuation based on a configured value

These modes can be selected using [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1). In the case of the "configured" mode, the user should input the maximum C/N0 observed in a clear-sky environment, excluding any outliers or unusually high values. The configured value can have a large impact on the receiver performance, so should be chosen carefully.

## <span id="page-85-0"></span>**18 Remote Inventory**

## <span id="page-85-1"></span>**18.1 Description**

The Remote Inventory enables storing user-defined data in the non-volatile memory of the receiver. The data can be either binary or a string of ASCII characters. In the second case, it will be output at startup after the boot screen.

## <span id="page-85-2"></span>**18.2 Usage**

- The contents of the Remote Inventory can be set and polled with the message [UBX-CFG-RINV](#page-269-1). Refer to the message specification for a detailed description.
- If the contents of the Remote Inventory are polled without having been set before, the default configuration (see table below) is output.

#### **Default configuration**

| Parameter | Value                    |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| flags     | 0x00                     |
| data      | "Notice: no data saved!" |

As with all configuration changes, these must be saved in order to be made permanent. Make sure to save the section RINV before resetting or switching off the receiver. For more information about saving a configuration, see section [Configuration Concept](#page-23-2).

## <span id="page-85-3"></span>**19 Time pulse**

For protocol versions less than 18, functionality of the time pulse has not been characterized when only BeiDou is enabled.

The time pulse feature is not available for protocol versions 23-23.01.

## <span id="page-85-4"></span>**19.1 Introduction**

u-blox receivers include a time pulse function providing clock pulses with configurable duration and frequency. The time pulse function can be configured using the [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) message. The [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message provides time information for the next pulse, time source and the quantization error of the output pin.





## <span id="page-86-0"></span>**19.2 Recommendations**

- The time pulse can be aligned to a wide variety of GNSS times or to variants of UTC derived from them (see the section on [time bases\)](#page-87-0). However, it is strongly recommended that the choice of time base is aligned with the available GNSS signals (so to produce GPS time or UTC(USNO), ensure GPS signals are available, and for GLONASS time or UTC(SU) ensure the presence GLONASS signals). This will involve coordinating that the setting of [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1) with the choice of time pulse time base.
- For best time pulse performance it is recommended to disable the SBAS subsystem.
- When using time pulse for precision timing applications it is recommended to calibrate the antenna cable delay against a reference-timing source.
- Care needs to be given to the cable delay settings in the receiver configuration.
- In order to get the best timing accuracy with the antenna, a fixed and accurate position is needed.
- If relative time accuracy between multiple receivers is required, do not mix receivers of different product families. If this is required, the receivers must be calibrated accordingly, by setting cable delay and user delay.
- The recommended configuration when using the [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message is to set both the measurement rate ([UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1)) and the time pulse frequency ([UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1)) to 1 Hz.
- Since the rate of [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) is bound to the measurement rate, more than one [UBX-](#page-446-1)[TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message can appear between two pulses if the measurement rate is set larger than the time pulse frequency. In this case all [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) messages in between a time pulse T1 and T2 belong to T2 and the last [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) before T2 reports the most accurate quantization error. In general, if the navigation solution rate and time pulse rate are configured to different values, there will not be a single [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message for each time pulse.

The sequential order of the signal present at the TIMEPULSE pin and the respective output message for the simple case of 1 pulse per second (1PPS) and a one second navigation update rate is shown in the following figure.





## <span id="page-87-0"></span>**19.3 GNSS time bases**

GNSS receivers must handle a variety of different time bases as each GNSS has its own reference system time. What is more, although each GNSS provides a model for converting their system time into UTC, they all support a slightly different variant of UTC. So, for example, GPS supports a variant of UTC as defined by the US National Observatory, while BeiDou uses UTC from the National Time Service Center, China (NTSC) and NavIC uses UTC from National Physics Laboratory, India (NPLI). While the different UTC variants are normally closely aligned, they can differ by as much as a few hundreds of nanoseconds.

Although u-blox receivers can combine a variety of different GNSS times internally, the user must choose a single type of GNSS time and, separately, a single type of UTC for input (on EXTINTs) and output (via the Time Pulse) and the parameters reported in corresponding messages.

For [protocol versions 16 or greater,](#page-14-0) the [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) message allows the user to choose between any of the supported GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, etc.) times and UTC. Also, the [UBX-CFG-](#page-230-1)[NAV5](#page-230-1) message allows the user to select which variant of UTC the receiver should use. This includes an "automatic" option which causes the receiver to select an appropriate UTC version itself, based on the [GNSS configuration](#page-28-0), using, in order of preference, USNO if GPS is enabled, SU if GLONASS is enabled, NTSC if BeiDou is enabled, European if Galileo is enabled and, finally, NPLI if NavIC is enabled.

Note that for [protocol versions prior to 16,](#page-14-0) no choice of UTC variant is supported and the [UBX-CFG-](#page-284-1)[TP5](#page-284-1) message only allows the user to choose between GPS and UTC as the time system the generated time pulse will be aligned to.

The receiver will assume that the input time pulse uses the same GNSS time base as specified for the output using [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1). So if the user selects GLONASS time for time pulse output, any time pulse input must also be aligned to GLONASS time (or to the separately chosen variant of UTC). Where UTC is selected for time pulse output, any GNSS time pulse input will be assumed to be aligned to GPS time.

- u-blox receivers allow users to choose independently GNSS signals used in the receiver (using [UBX-CFG-GNSS](#page-221-1)) and the input/output time base (using [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1)). For example it is possible to instruct the receiver to use GPS and GLONASS satellite signals to generate BeiDou time. This practice will compromise time-pulse accuracy if the receiver cannot measure the timing difference between the constellations directly and is not recommended.

The information that allows GNSS times to be converted to the associated UTC times is



only transmitted by the GNSS at relatively infrequent periods. For example GPS transmits UTC(USNO) information only once every 12.5 minutes. Therefore, if a Time Pulse is configured to use a variant of UTC time, after a cold start, substantial delays before the receiver has sufficient information to start outputing the Time Pulse can be expected.

## <span id="page-88-0"></span>**19.4 Time pulse configuration**

u-blox receivers provide one or two TIMEPULSE pins (dependent on product variant) delivering a time pulse (TP) signal with a configurable pulse period, pulse length and polarity (rising or falling edge). Check the product data sheet for detailed specification of configurable values.

It is possible to define different signal behavior (i.e. output frequency and pulse length) depending on whether or not the receiver is locked to a reliable time source. Time pulse signals can be configured using the UBX proprietary message [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1).

## <span id="page-88-1"></span>**19.5 Configuring time pulse with UBX-CFG-TP5**

The UBX message [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) can be used to change the time pulse settings, and includes the following parameters defining the pulse:

- **time pulse index** Index of time pulse output pin to be configured. If a product only has one time pulse output it is typically configurable with index 0. Exceptions to this include LEA-M8F, M8030-KT-FT and NEO-M8L. Refer to specific product documentation.
- **antenna cable delay** Signal delay due to the cable between antenna and receiver.
- **RF group delay** Signal delay in the RF module of the receiver (read-only).
- **pulse frequency/period** Frequency or period time of the pulse when locked mode is not configured or active.
- **pulse frequency/period lock** Frequency or period time of the pulse, as soon as receiver has calculated a valid time from a received signal. Only used if the corresponding flag is set to use another setting in locked mode.
- **pulse length/ratio** Length or duty cycle of the generated pulse, either specifies a time or ratio for the pulse to be on/off.
- **pulse length/ratio lock** Length or duty cycle of the generated pulse, as soon as receiver has calculated a valid time from a received signal. Only used if the corresponding flag is set to use another setting in locked mode.
- **user delay** The cable delay from the receiver to the user device plus signal delay of any user application.
- **active** time pulse will be active if this bit is set.
- **lock to gps freq** Use frequency gained from GPS signal information rather than local oscillator's frequency if flag is set.
- **lock to gnss freq** Use frequency gained from GNSS signal information rather than local oscillator's frequency if flag is set.
- **locked other setting** If this bit is set, as soon as the receiver can calculate a valid time, the alternative setting is used. This mode can be used for example to disable time pulse if time is not locked, or indicate lock with different duty cycles.
- **is frequency** Interpret the 'Frequency/Period' field as frequency rather than period if flag is set.
- **is length** Interpret the 'Length/Ratio' field as length rather than ratio if flag is set.



- **align to TOW** If this bit is set, pulses are aligned to the top of a second.
- **polarity** If set, the first edge of the pulse is a rising edge (Pulse Mode: Rising).
- **grid UTC/GPS** Selection between UTC (0) or GPS (1) timegrid. Also effects the time output by [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message.
- **grid UTC/GNSS** Selection between UTC (0), GPS (1), GLONASS (2) and Beidou (3) timegrid. Also effects the time output by [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message.



The maximum pulse length can't exceed the pulse period.

- Time pulse settings shall be chosen in such a way, that neither the high nor the low period of the output is less than 50 ns (except when disabling it completely), otherwise pulses can be lost.
- The maximum frequency of the second time pulse pin (TIMEPULSE2) is limited to 1 kHz for [protocol versions less than 18](#page-14-0) unless using a Timing product variant.

## <span id="page-89-0"></span>**19.5.1 Example 1**

The example below shows the 1PPS TP signal generated on the time pulse output according to the specific parameters of the [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) message:

- **tpIdx** = 0
- **freqPeriod** = 1 s
- **pulseLenRatio** = 100 ms
- **active** = 1
- **lockGpsFreq = lockGnssFreq** = 1
- **isLength** = 1
- **alignToTow** = 1
- **polarity** = 1
- **gridUtcGps = gridUtcGnss** = 1

The 1 Hz output is maintained whether or not the receiver is locked to GPS time. The alignment to TOW can only be maintained when GPS time is locked.



## <span id="page-89-1"></span>**19.5.2 Example 2**

This example only works with a Timing product variant or for [protocol versions greater than 17](#page-14-0).

The following example shows a 10 MHz TP signal generated on the TIMEPULSE2 output when the receiver is locked to GPS time. Without the lock to GPS time no frequency is output.





- **freqPeriod** = 1 Hz
- **pulseLenRatio** = 0
- **freqPeriodLock** = 10 MHz
- **pulseLenRatioLock** = 50%
- **active** = 1
- **lockGpsFreq = lockGnssFreq** = 1
- **lockedOtherSet** = 1
- **isFreq** = 1
- **alignToTow** = 1
- **polarity** = 1
- **gridUtcGps = gridUtcGnss** = 1

## <span id="page-90-0"></span>**20 Timemark**

The receiver can be used to provide an accurate measurement of the time at which a pulse was detected on the external interrupt pin. The reference time can be chosen by setting the time source parameter to UTC, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo or local time in the [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) configuration message. The UTC standard can be set in the [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-284-1) configuration message. The delay figures defined with [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1) are also applied to the results output in the [UBX-TIM-TM2](#page-443-1) message.

A [UBX-TIM-TM2](#page-443-1) message is output at the next epoch if

- the [UBX-TIM-TM2](#page-443-1) message is enabled
- a rising or falling edge was triggered since last epoch on one of the EXTINT channels

The [UBX-TIM-TM2](#page-443-1) messages include time of the last timemark, new rising/falling edge indicator, time source, validity, number of marks and a quantization error. The timemark is triggered continuously.

Only the last rising and falling edge detected between two epochs is reported since the output rate of the [UBX-TIM-TM2](#page-443-1) message corresponds to the measurement rate configured with [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1) (see Figure below).





## <span id="page-91-0"></span>**21 Odometer**

## <span id="page-91-1"></span>**21.1 Introduction**

The odometer provides information on travelled ground distance (in meter) using solely the position and Doppler-based velocity of the navigation solution. For each computed travelled distance since the last odometer reset, the odometer estimates a 1-sigma accuracy value. The total cumulative ground distance is maintained and saved in the BBR memory.

The odometer feature is disabled by default. It can be enabled using the [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) message.

## <span id="page-91-2"></span>**21.2 Odometer Output**

The odometer output is published in the [UBX-NAV-ODO](#page-384-1) message. This message contains the following elements:

- Ground distance since last reset (distance field): this distance is defined as the total cumulated distance in meters since the last time the odometer was reset (see section [Resetting the](#page-92-1) [Odometer\)](#page-92-1);
- Ground distance accuracy (distanceStd field): this quantity is defined as the 1-sigma accuracy estimate (in meters) associated to the Ground distance since last reset value;
- Total cumulative ground distance (totalDistance field): this quantity is defined as the total cumulated distance in meters since the last time the receiver was cold started (see section [Resetting the Odometer\)](#page-92-1).

If logging is enabled, then the odometer's ground distance since last reset value will be included in



the logged position data (see section [Logging](#page-92-2)).

## <span id="page-92-0"></span>**21.3 Odometer Configuration**

The odometer can be enabled/disabled by setting the appropriate flag in [UBX-CFG-ODO](#page-248-1) (flags field). The algorithm behaviour can be optimized by setting up a profile (odoCfg field) representative of the context in which the receiver is operated. The implemented profiles together with their meanings are listed below:

- Running: the algorithm is optimized for typical dynamics encountered while running, i.e the Doppler-based velocity solution is assumed to be of lower quality;
- Cycling: the algorithm is optimized for typical dynamics encountered while cycling;
- Swimming: the algorithm is optimized for very slow and smooth trajectories typically encountered while swimming;
- Car: the algorithm assumes that good Doppler measurements are available (i.e. the antenna is subject to low vibrations) and is optimized for typical dynamics encountered by cars.
- The odometer can only be reliably operated in a swimming context if satellite signals are available and the antenna is not immersed.

## <span id="page-92-1"></span>**21.4 Resetting the Odometer**

The odometer outputs (see [UBX-NAV-ODO](#page-384-1) message) can be reset by the following means:

- Ground distance since last reset (distance field): by sending a [UBX-NAV-RESETODO](#page-395-2) message;
- Ground distance accuracy (distanceStd field): by sending a [UBX-NAV-RESETODO](#page-395-2) message;
- Total cumulative ground distance (totalDistance): by a cold start of the receiver (this erases the BBR memory);

## <span id="page-92-2"></span>**22 Logging**

## <span id="page-92-3"></span>**22.1 Introduction**

The logging feature allows position fixes and arbitrary byte strings from the host to be logged in flash memory attached to the receiver. Logging of position fixes happens independently of the host system, and can continue while the host is powered down.

The following tables list all the logging related messages:

## **Logging control and configuration messages**

| Message           | Description                                                        |

| UBX-LOG-ERASE     | Erases a log file and deactivates the logging subsystem            |
| UBX-CFG-LOGFILTER | Used to start/stop recording and set/get the logging configuration |

|                                                  |

## <span id="page-93-0"></span>**22.2 Setting the logging system up**

An empty log can be created using the [UBX-LOG-CREATE](#page-311-1) message and a log can be deleted with the [UBX-LOG-ERASE](#page-312-2) message. The logging system will only be running if a log is in existence, so most logging messages will be rejected with an [UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message if there is no log present. Only one log can be created at any one time so an [UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) message will be returned if a log already exists. The message specifies the maximum size of the log in bytes (with some pre-set values provided). Both the logging subsystem and the receiver file-store have implementation overheads, so total space available for log entries will be somewhat smaller than the size specified.

[UBX-LOG-CREATE](#page-311-1) also allows the log to be specified as a circular log. If the log is circular, then when it fills up, a set of older log entries will be deleted and the space freed up used for new log entries. By contrast, if a non-circular log becomes full then new entries which do not fit will be rejected. [UBX-LOG-CREATE](#page-311-1) also causes the logging system to start up so that further logging messages can be processed. The logging system will start up automatically on power-up if there is a log in existence. The log will remain in the receiver until specifically erased using the [UBX-LOG-](#page-312-2)[ERASE](#page-312-2) message.

[UBX-CFG-LOGFILTER](#page-227-1) controls whether logging of entries is currently enabled and selects position fix messages for logging. These configuration settings will be saved if the configuration is saved to flash. If this is done, then entry logging will continue on power-up in the same manner that it did before power-down.

**The top level active/inactive states of the logging subsystem.**



## <span id="page-93-1"></span>**22.3 Information about the log**

The receiver can be polled for a [UBX-LOG-INFO](#page-314-1) message which will give information about the log. This will include the maximum size that the log can grow to (which, due to overheads, will be smaller than that requested in [UBX-LOG-CREATE](#page-311-1)) and the amount of log space currently occupied. It will also report the number of entries currently in the log together with the time and date of the newest and oldest messages which have a valid time stamp.

Log entries are compressed and have housekeeping information associated with them, so the actual space occupied by log messages may be difficult to predict. The minimum size for a



position fix entry is 9 bytes and the maximum 24 bytes, the typical size is 10 or 11 bytes. If the odometer is enabled then this will use at least another three bytes per fix.

Each log also has a fixed overhead which is dependent on the log type. The approximate size of this overhead is shown in the following table.

## **Log overhead size**

| Log type     | Overhead    |
|--------------|-------------|
| circular     | Up to 40 kB |
| non-circular | Up to 8 kB  |

The number of entries that can be logged in any given flash size can be estimated as follows:

Approx. number of entries = (flash size available for logging - log overhead)/typical entry size

For example, if 1500 kB of flash is available for logging (after other flash usage such as the firmware image is taken into account) a non-circular log would be able to contain approximately 139000 entries ((1500\*1024)-(8\*1024))/11 = 138891.

## <span id="page-94-0"></span>**22.4 Recording**

The [UBX-CFG-LOGFILTER](#page-227-1) message specifies the conditions under which entries are recorded. Nothing will be recorded if recording is disabled, otherwise position fix and [UBX-LOG-STRING](#page-320-1) entries can be recorded. When recording is enabled an entry will also be created from each [UBX-](#page-320-1)[LOG-STRING](#page-320-1) message. These will be timestamped if the receiver has current knowledge of time.

The [UBX-CFG-LOGFILTER](#page-227-1) message has several values which can be used to select position fix entries for logging. If all of these values are zero, then all position fixes will be logged (subject to a maximum rate of 1Hz). A position is logged if any of the thresholds are exceeded. If a threshold is set to zero it is ignored. In addition the position difference and current speed thresholds also have a minimum time threshold.

Position fixes are only recorded if a valid fix is obtained - failed and invalid fixes are not recorded.

Position fixes are compressed to economise on the amount of flash space used. In order to improve the compression, the fix values are rounded to improve their compression. This means that the values returned by the logging system may differ slightly from any which are gathered in real time.

In [On/Off power save mode](#page-73-0) it is possible to configure the logging system so that only one fix is recorded for each on period. This will be recorded immediately before the receiver powers off and will be the best fix seen during the on period (in this case, "best" is defined as being the fix with the lowest horizontal accuracy figure).

The recorded data for a fix comprises :

- The time and date of the fix recorded to a precision of one second.
- Latitude and longitude to a precision of one millionth of a degree. Depending on position on Earth this is a precision in the order of 0.1 m.
- Altitude (height above mean sea level) to a precision of 0.1 m. Entries with an altitude lower than -470 m (lower than the lowest point on earth) or higher than 20,000 m may not be recorded in the log.
- Ground speed to a precision of 1 cm/s
- The fix type (only successful fix types, since these are the only ones recorded).



- The number of satellites used in the fix is recorded, but there is a maximum count which can be recorded. If the actual count exceeds this maximum count then the maximum count will be recorded. If a log entry is retrieved with a satellite count equal to the maximum this means that value or more. The maximum count is 51. (The maximum count is 19 in [protocol versions less](#page-15-2) [than 24](#page-15-2)).
- A horizontal accuracy estimate is recorded to give an indication of fix quality. This is an approximate compressed representation of the accuracy as determined by the fix process. Any accuracy less than 0.7 m will be recorded as 0.7 m and any value above 1 km will be recorded as 1km. Within these limits, the recorded accuracy will always be greater than the fix accuracy number (by up to 40%).
- Heading to a precision of one degree.
- Odometer distance data (if odometer is enabled).

## **The states of the active logging subsystem**



## <span id="page-95-0"></span>**22.5 Retrieval**

[UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE](#page-319-1) starts the process which allows the receiver to output log entries. Log recording must be stopped using [UBX-CFG-LOGFILTER](#page-227-1) before this can be done. [UBX-LOG-INFO](#page-314-1) may be helpful to a host system in order to understand the current log status before retrieval is started.

Once retrieval has started, one message will be output from the receiver for each log entry requested. Sending any logging message to the receiver during retrieval will cause the retrieval to stop before the message is processed.

To maximise the speed of transfer it is recommended that a high communications data rate is used and GNSS processing is stopped during the transfer (see [UBX-CFG-RST](#page-270-1))

[UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE](#page-319-1) can specify a start-entry index and entry-count. The maximum number of entries that can be returned in response to a single [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE](#page-319-1) message is 256. If more entries than this are required the message will need to be sent multiple times with different startEntry indices.



The receiver will send a [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEPOS](#page-317-2) message for each position fix log entry and a [UBX-](#page-318-1)[LOG-RETRIEVESTRING](#page-318-1) message for each string log entry. If the odometer was enabled at the time a position was logged, then a [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEPOSEXTRA](#page-317-2) will also be sent. Messages will be sent in the order in which they were logged, so [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEPOS](#page-317-2) and [UBX-LOG-](#page-318-1)[RETRIEVESTRING](#page-318-1) messages may be interspersed in the message stream.

The [UBX-LOG-FINDTIME](#page-312-2) message can be used to search a log for the index of the first entry less than or equal to the given time. This index can then be used with the [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE](#page-319-1) message to provide time-based retrieval of log entries.

## <span id="page-96-0"></span>**22.6 Command message acknowledgement**

Some log operations may take a long time to execute because of the time taken to write to flash memory. The time for some operations may be unpredictable since the number and timing of flash operations may vary. In order to allow host software to synchronise to these delays logging messages will always produce a response. This will be [UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0) in case of error, otherwise [UBX-](#page-193-0)[ACK-ACK](#page-193-0) unless there is some other defined response to the message.

It is possible to send a small number of logging commands without waiting for acknowledgement, since there is a command queue, but this risks confusion between the acknowledgements for the commands. Also a command queue overflow would result in commands being lost.

## <span id="page-96-1"></span>**23 Data Batching**

(Note: this functionality is supported only in [protocol versions 23.01](#page-15-2)).

## <span id="page-96-2"></span>**23.1 Introduction**

The data batching feature allows position fixes to be stored in the RAM of the receiver to be retrieved later in one batch. Batching of position fixes happens independently of the host system, and can continue while the host is powered down.

The following tables list all the batching related messages:

| Message       | Description                                                           |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| UBX-CFG-BATCH | Used to enable and configure the batching feature                     |
| UBX-MON-BATCH | Provides information about the buffer fill level and dropped data due |
|               | to overrun                                                            |

## **Batching control and configuration messages**

## **Batch retrieval messages**

| Message               | Description                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEBATCH | Starts the batch retrieval process     |
| UBX-LOG-BATCH         | A batch entry returned by the receiver |

## <span id="page-96-3"></span>**23.2 Setting up the data batching**

Data batching is disabled per default and it has to be configured before use via [UBX-CFG-BATCH](#page-206-1).

The feature must be enabled and the buffer size must be set to greater than 0. It is possible to set up a PIO as a flag that indicates when the buffer is close to filling up. The fill level when this PIO is asserted can be set by the user separately from the buffer size. The notification fill level must not be larger than the buffer size.

If the host does not retrieve the batched fixes before the buffer fills up the oldest fix will be



dropped and replaced with the newest.

The RAM available in the chip limits the size of the buffer. To make the best use of the available space users can select what data they want to batch. When batching is enabled a basic set of data is stored and the configuration flags extraPvt and extraOdo can be used to store more detailed information about the position fixes. Doing so reduces the number of fixes that can be batched.

The receiver will reject configuration if it cannot allocate the required buffer memory. To ensure robust operation of the receiver the following limits are enforced:

| extraPvt | extraOdo | Maximum number of epochs |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| 0        | 0        | 300                      |
| 0        | 1        | 221                      |
| 1        | 0        | 156                      |
| 1        | 1        | 132                      |

## **Maximum number of batched epochs**

It is recommended to disable all periodic output messages when using batching. This improves system robustness and also helps ensure that the output of batched data is not delayed by other messages.

The buffer size is set up in terms of navigation epochs. This means that the time that can be covered with a certain buffer depends on the navigation rate. This rate can be set separately for full power operation via [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1) and for power save mode via the updatePeriod in [UBX-CFG-PM2](#page-249-1).

Data batching settings should not be re-configured while retrieving data from the buffer.

## <span id="page-97-0"></span>**23.3 Retrieval**

[UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEBATCH](#page-316-1) starts the process which allows the receiver to output batch entries. Batching must not be stopped for readout; all batched data is lost when the feature is disabled. Batched fixes are always retrieved starting with the oldest fix in the buffer and progressing towards newer ones. There is no way to skip certain fixes during retrieval.

When a [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEBATCH](#page-316-1) message is sent the receiver transmits all batched fixes. It is recommended to send a retrieval request with sendMonFirst set. This way the receiver will send a [UBX-MON-BATCH](#page-352-0) message first that contains the number of fixes in the batching buffer. This information can be used to detect when the u-blox receiver finished sending data.

Once retrieval has started, the receiver will first send [UBX-MON-BATCH](#page-352-0) if sendMonFirst option was selected in the [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEBATCH](#page-316-1). After that, it will send [UBX-LOG-BATCH](#page-308-0) messages with the batched fixes.

To maximise the speed of transfer it is recommended that a high communications data rate is used.

- The receiver will discard retrieval request while processing a previous [UBX-LOG-](#page-316-1)[RETRIEVEBATCH](#page-316-1) message.
- The receiver does **not** acknowledge the reception of [UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEBATCH](#page-316-1); the response that the host should expect are the reply messages.



## <span id="page-98-0"></span>**24 Geofencing**

(Note: this feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 18\)](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-98-1"></span>**24.1 Introduction**



The geofencing feature allows for the configuration of up to four circular areas (geofences) on the Earth's surface. The receiver will then evaluate for each of these areas whether the current position lies within the area or not and signal the state via UBX messaging and PIO toggling.

## <span id="page-98-2"></span>**24.2 Interface**

Geofencing can be configured using the [UBX-CFG-GEOFENCE](#page-220-1) message. The geofence evaluation is active whenever there is at least one geofence configured.

The current state of each geofence plus the combined state is output in [UBX-NAV-GEOFENCE](#page-377-2) with every navigation epoch.

Additionally the user can configure the receiver to output the combined geofence state on a physical pin.

## <span id="page-98-3"></span>**24.3 Geofence state evaluation**

With every navigation epoch the receiver will evaluate the current solution's position versus the configured geofences. There are three possible outcomes for each geofence:

- Inside The position is inside the geofence with the configured confidence level
- Outside The position lies outside of the geofence with the configured confidence level
- Unknown There is no valid position solution or the position uncertainty does not allow for unambiguous state evaluation

The position solution uncertainty (standard deviation) is multiplied with the configured confidence sigma level number and taken into account when evaluating the geofence state (red circle in figure below).



The combined state for all geofences is evaluated as the combination (logical OR) of all geofences:

- Inside The position lies inside of at least one geofence
- Outside The position lies outside of all geofences
- Unknown All remaining states



## <span id="page-99-0"></span>**24.4 Using a PIO for Geofence State Output**

This feature can be used for example for waking up a sleeping host when a defined geofence condition is reached. The receiver will toggle the assigned pin according to the combined geofence state. Due to hardware restrictions the unknown state will always be represented as HIGH. If the receiver is in software backup or in a reset, the pin will go to HIGH accordingly. The meaning of the LOW state can be configured using [UBX-CFG-GEOFENCE](#page-220-1).

## <span id="page-99-1"></span>**25 Time Mode Configuration**

This feature is only available with Timing, FTS or High Precision GNSS (HPG) products

This section relates to the configuration message [UBX-CFG-TMODE2](#page-280-2) (for Timing or FTS products) and to the configuration message [UBX-CFG-TMODE3](#page-282-1) (for HPG products).

## <span id="page-99-2"></span>**25.1 Introduction**

Time Mode is a special receiver mode where the position of the receiver is known and fixed and only the time is calculated using all available satellites. This mode allows for maximum time accuracy, for single-SV solutions, and also for using the receiver as a stationary reference station.

## <span id="page-99-3"></span>**25.2 Fixed Position**

In order to use the Time Mode, the receiver's position must be known as exactly as possible. Either the user already knows and enters the position, or it is determined using [Survey-in](#page-99-4). Errors in the fixed position will translate into time errors depending on the satellite constellation.

For Timing products, as a rule of thumb the position should be known with an accuracy of better than 1 m for a timing accuracy in the order of nanoseconds. If an accuracy is required only in the order of microseconds, a position accuracy of roughly 300 m is sufficient.

For HPG products, errors in the reference station position will directly translate into rover position errors. The reference station position accuracy should therefore be at least as good as the desired rover absolute position accuracy.

## <span id="page-99-4"></span>**25.3 Survey-in**

Survey-in is the procedure that is carried out prior to using Time Mode. It determines a stationary receiver's position by building a weighted mean of all valid 3D position solutions.

Two requirements for stopping the procedure must be specified:

- The **minimum observation time** defines a minimum amount of observation time regardless of the actual number of valid fixes that were used for the position calculation. Reasonable values range from one day for high accuracy requirements to a few minutes for coarse position determination.
- The **required 3D position standard deviation** defines a limit on the spread of positions that contribute to the calculated mean. As the position error translates into a time error when using Time Mode (see [above](#page-99-3)), one should carefully evaluate the time accuracy requirements and choose an appropriate value.

Survey-in ends, when **both** requirements are met. After Survey-in has finished successfully, the receiver will automatically enter fixed position Time Mode.

The Survey-in status can queried using the [UBX-TIM-SVIN](#page-442-1) message for Timing or FTS products or



the [UBX-NAV-SVIN](#page-406-1) message for HPG products.

- The "Standard Deviation" parameter defines uncertainty of the manually provided "True Position" set of parameters. This uncertainty directly affects the accuracy of the timepulse. This is to prevent an error that would otherwise be present in the timepulse because of the initially inaccurate position (assumed to be correct by the receiver) without users being aware of it. The "3D accuracy" parameter in "Fixed Position" as well as the "Position accuracy limit" in "Survey-in" affect the produced time information and the timepulse in the same way. Note that the availability of the position accuracy does not mitigate the error in the timepulse but only accounts for it when calculating the resulting time accuracy.
- Once a survey-in has been started, its progress is saved in non-volatile memory, and hence continues over events such as a reset, receiver restart, or change of satellite constellation. If a survey-in position is required using data only for a particular receiver configuration, then any on-going survey-in should be stopped by either a [UBX-CFG-](#page-280-2)[TMODE2](#page-280-2) or a [UBX-CFG-TMODE3](#page-282-1) message with the timeMode field set to 0, then the receiver configured as required, and then a new [UBX-CFG-TMODE2](#page-280-2) or [UBX-CFG-TMODE3](#page-282-1) message sent with the new survey-in parameters.

## <span id="page-100-0"></span>**26 Time & Frequency Sync (FTS)**

The features described in this section are only available with the FTS products

## <span id="page-100-1"></span>**26.1 Introduction**

An FTS configured receiver provides an accurate, low phase-noise reference frequency as well as phase reference pulse (typically at one pulse per second). An FTS receiver also implements automatic hold-over capability based on a stable VCTCXO in modules and the customer's choice of reference oscillator in chip-based designs. It offers generic interfaces for external sources of synchronization (suitable for external OCXOs, IEEE1588 or Synchronous Ethernet). The receiver is optimized for stationary applications and delivers excellent GNSS sensitivity in conjunction with assistance data.

In the rest of this description the following terminology will be used:

- Disciplined oscillator: an oscillator whose frequency is corrected by a more stable frequency reference, such as a GNSS system.
- Internal oscillator: the mandatory disciplined oscillator which is used as the reference frequency for the GNSS receiver subsystem. The output from this oscillator is also available to the application as an output from the module.
- External oscillator: an optional oscillator, disciplined by the receiver, either via I2C DAC or via UBX messages handle by a host.
- Source: a source of frequency and/or phase synchronization either measured by the receiver based on direct hardware input or an offset estimated by an external timing sub-system with respect to the receiver output. Sources are handled according to related estimates of uncertainty delivered by the application or (for oscillators) configurable models provided by the receiver.
- Holdover: periods when GNSS measurements of sufficient quality to maintain time/frequency are not available.



In all FTS related messages the above sources are indexed as follows:

## **Synchronization source indexing**

| Source                              | Index |
|-------------------------------------|-------|
| Internal oscillator                 | 0     |

The remainder of this chapter describes some typical use cases, introduces the Synchronization Manager (SMGR) functionality unique to FTS products and describes the use of related messages.

## <span id="page-101-0"></span>**26.2 Example use cases**

In this section some typical use cases are described.

## <span id="page-101-1"></span>**26.2.1 Stand-alone synchronization system**





In this example, the FTS device provides a stand-alone synchronization sub-system in the context of, say, a small cell. The module's internal 30.72MHz VCTCXO is disciplined by the module and provides the frequency reference to the platform. The module provides a PPS signal to synchronize the platform's physical layer. A 1PPS (or frequency) input to the module provides frequency and/or phase information from host timing sub-systems such as PTP or Sync-E. In the absence of phase information from GNSS or any other source, the module relies on the VCTCXO for synchronization holdover, augmented by any reliable source of frequency control. In the absence of frequency control, the holdover performance is determined entirely by the VCTCXO. In some applications holdover performance will be enhanced by using an external stable (but not necessarily accurate) frequency reference.

<span id="page-102-0"></span>

## **26.2.2 Oscillator control via host**



The frequency offset of the external oscillator is measured by the FTS device and communicated to the host which can then make any corrections necessary. The FTS device also generates a PPS phase reference internally (with no guarantee of coherence with the external oscillator). During holdover, the phase of 1PPS signal is maintained using either the primary reference oscillator or the 1PPS\_In signal, according to their respective uncertainty.

<span id="page-103-0"></span>



In this use case, the FTS device disciplines an external oscillator via an external DAC. During holdover the input to the external DAC is frozen and the phase of the time pulse output is maintained by the primary reference oscillator, but only guaranteed to be fully coherent with the internal oscillator. The FTS receiver can also be commanded to perform a one-off calibration of the tuning slope of external oscillator if necessary.

## <span id="page-103-1"></span>**26.2.4 External (coherent) PPS**





In this use case, the system PPS is generated by an external device from the output of the primary reference oscillator. The FTS receiver measures the phase of this PPS input against GNSS time or the best available source. Any small phase corrections necessary can be made by the receiver via adjustments to the oscillator frequency or directly by the host to the PPS generator (e.g. to accelerate removal of large phase errors). During holdover the DAC input is frozen.

## <span id="page-104-0"></span>**26.3 Synchronization Manager Concept**

The Synchronization Manager (SMGR) assumes the frequency and phase control functions in FTS configured devices. The SMGR uses internal and external phase and frequency measurements to derive the disciplining values (necessary frequency changes) and to assess the quality (uncertainty) of the time pulse signal and the frequency outputs. The SMGR considers the following synchronization sources:

- The GNSS solutions
- Internal oscillator
- Up to two external signals: frequency or time pulse (e.g. 1PPS) reference signals on EXTINT0 and/or EXTINT1
- Externally conducted measurements, from which the results are sent to the receiver through one of the host interfaces

Each measurement provides frequency offset and/or phase information along with an estimate of the uncertainty of each. The SMGR functional block diagram is given below:





The user has the option to configure how the SMGR considers the external signals, e.g. time or frequency source, disciplined or not, etc... The user must also configure the uncertainty of the signals along with their nominal characteristics. One of the external signals may be configured as the feedback path of a disciplined external oscillator.

The SMGR can operate in frequency locked or in phase locked mode. In frequency locked mode the target of the SMGR is to eliminate frequency error. In phase locked mode the elimination of time error is the goal; this may lead to intentional deviation from the correct oscillator frequency. The correction rate in both of these modes is subject to configurable limits (see [UBX-CFG-SMGR](#page-277-1)). The SMGR runs periodically (typically once a second). Its operation consists of the following stages each time it is executed:

- Choose the best source to be the reference, given the characteristics (phase noise and stability) of each of the sources and the uncertainty of their measurements.
- Calculate the phase and/or frequency errors as well as their uncertainty for each of the disciplined oscillators with respect to the reference source.
- Calculate correction for disciplined oscillators; time and/or frequency corrections are limited to the configured limits.
- Map frequency adjustment to physical output.

The SMGR runs periodically and retrieves the most recent measurements for each source along with the estimates about their respective uncertainty. The relative phase and/or frequency errors of disciplined oscillators with respect to the reference are calculated from incoming measurements and used to discipline them. The decision-making process as such does not depend on decisions made previously, however it does rely on the estimated uncertainty for each source, which is determined by comparing predicted and measured values over some moderate period of time. The SMGR only uses a single reference source at any one time. It does not combine measurements from different sources in any way. If the selected reference provides a time error measurement then a phase locked loop is possible, otherwise the receiver automatically enters frequency lock even if configured to maintain a phase lock.

In some cases the host software might choose to drive an oscillator directly. This may be useful



where a large timing error has accumulated (e.g. after a long period of holdover) and normal operation would prevent the error being corrected swiftly. In this case, the host can deliberately steer the oscillator to correct timing in large steps as configured maximum phase and frequency change limits are not applied to adjustments commanded by the host. Another use of the direct host-driven steering may be the calibration of other parts of the system. Use [UBX-TIM-HOC](#page-439-1) message for this functionality.

If the time error is so large that its correction would take prohibitively long even with maximum frequency offset of the oscillator the receiver can be switched to non-coherent time pulse output mode. In this case the sync manager is temporarily reconfigured to allow time pulse intervals that are not coherent with the frequency output, i.e. there are more or less than the nominal number of cycles between two pulses. The user may optionally specify a limit on time adjustments. The output mode can be set to coherent again once the time error is sufficiently small.

A SMGR summary status is provided by [UBX-MON-SMGR](#page-361-1) message.

The SMGR runs at the navigation rate set by [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1). For FTS configured devices, it is not recommended to use navigation rates higher than 1Hz.

## <span id="page-106-0"></span>**26.4 Oscillator and source specification**

For correct operation, the frequency, phase and stability characteristics of all sources and disciplined oscillators must be described. External synchronization sources are configured with [UBX-CFG-ESRC](#page-218-1) and disciplined oscillators with [UBX-CFG-DOSC](#page-211-2). The models (short and long term stability behavior) specified by these messages provide the SMGR with the knowledge necessary to its decision making.

The user must also configure the method (coherent or non-coherent) used for frequency adjustment, the maximum frequency adjustment and other parameters contained in [UBX-CFG-](#page-211-2)[DOSC](#page-211-2).

It is assumed that an external voltage-controlled oscillator has a constant ratio of relative frequency change to control voltage change. The oscillator is therefore characterized by two metrics: an offset (control voltage for nominal frequency) and a gain (relative frequency change per control step). Each of these parameters are known along with their uncertainty. It is assumed that the oscillator control gain is stable over time but its offset may change significantly with aging. Because of the drift of the offset, its saved value is regularly updated in the model. The gain, on the other hand, is only updated on demand by the host application by re-configuration or calibration. For the measurement of the gain a special auto-calibration is available, described in the [calibration section](#page-107-0).

External oscillator stability (frequency changes) is described by four parameters (see [UBX-CFG-](#page-211-2)[DOSC](#page-211-2)):

- changes with temperature: withTemp is the maximum deviation limit from the nominal frequency at the reference temperature over the supported temperature range (in ppb) and timeToTemp (in s) which is a period after which the maximum deviation limit is reached.
- aging: maxDevLifeTime is the maximum deviation from the nominal frequency (in ppb) and withAge is the oscillator stability with age (in ppb/year).



## <span id="page-107-0"></span>**26.5 Calibration**

Prior to disciplining an oscillator, the SMGR must have an accurate knowledge of the controlled oscillator's frequency control gain and initial frequency offset (oscillator gains may differ significantly from unit to unit and batch to batch, largely as a result of different crystal Q). The receiver provides a slope measurement utility to aid the calibration process.

The calibration utility is a special mode where all disciplining operations are suspended and therefore all disciplined oscillators, internal or external, cease to produce usable outputs. It takes place in response to a specific request ([UBX-TIM-VCOCAL](#page-448-1) message) from the host to do so for a particular oscillator and only one oscillator can be calibrated at a time. During this phase, the SMGR forces large frequency variations by changing the input of the digital to analogue conversion device whose output is driving the oscillator. Several frequency measurements are performed and a gain is estimated.



Calibration parameters must be configured or the calibration utility called before disciplining operation is possible. Once calibrated, the calibStatus flag in [UBX-CFG-DOSC](#page-211-2) is set. The calibration utility can be re-triggered at any time by issuing the appropriate command through the [UBX-TIM-VCOCAL](#page-448-1) message (not recommended during normal operation). An ongoing calibration process can be aborted using the same message with the appropriate flags. It can also be bypassed if the calibStatus flag in the [UBX-CFG-DOSC](#page-211-2) message is set to 1 (oscillator is calibrated independently with results saved using the UBX-CFG-DOSC message).

In order to enter the calibration mode it is required that:

- A stable frequency source is available for the duration of the calibration. This source may be a GNSS solution or a frequency signal on an EXTINT pin.
- The oscillator subject to calibration is configured through the [UBX-CFG-DOSC](#page-211-2) message (including an initial estimate of gain) and available for the duration of the process.

For an external oscillator it is also assumed that the useful range of the input is covered by the output of the DAC and that the relation frequency versus DAC input is linear. Once the calibration operation is complete the receiver will issue a UBX message to indicate that the SMGR is reverting to normal operation and to report the results of the calibration. A default for the internal oscillator is available in the firmware.

Note that it is important that only the chosen frequency source is enabled during the calibration process and that it remains stable throughout the calibration period; otherwise incorrect oscillator measurements will be made and this will lead to miscalibration and poor subsequent operation of the receiver.



## <span id="page-108-0"></span>**26.6 FTS device Output and Top Of Second (TOS) message**

The outputs available from an FTS device can be one or all of the following:

- A disciplined frequency source at the same frequency as the internal oscillator.
- A 1PPS or an even second signal (other similar rates are possible) coherent with the internal oscillator, configured by [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-284-1).
- Messages reporting measurement results (for example for a host disciplined external oscillator).
- A [UBX-TIM-TOS](#page-444-1) message which describes the current condition (accuracy, coherent or noncoherent, etc...) of the frequency and PPS outputs.
- DAC command for disciplined external oscillators.

The top of second (TOS) message is a summary of the FTS device's status. It is output shortly after each time pulse and so will normally be aligned to the second of the reference time (if available). To guarantee that this message is output as the first message after the time pulse a system of time slot reservation is provided for all communication interfaces towards the host. For more information on this mechanism refer to [the description of TX time slots](#page-109-0)

Users of the FTS variant are expected to use the [UBX-TIM-TOS](#page-444-1) message to obtain key parameters for each time pulse. The [UBX-TIM-TP](#page-446-1) message is only supported for compatibility with timing receivers and is not guaranteed to provide the most appropriate information in all FTS use cases.

## The time pulse of an FTS device is generated differently from that of other u-blox receivers.

FTS products support two modes of time pulse generation: "coherent" and "non-coherent" pulses. "Coherent" pulse generation means that the number of clock cycles between two pulses is always the same. When in "non-coherent" pulse mode the receiver may change the number of clock cycles between two pulses if it can thus reduce the phase error of the time pulse. The receiver can be configured (using [UBX-CFG-SMGR](#page-277-1)) to operate in either of these modes or to switch from "noncoherent" to coherent mode after initial frequency and phase error has been eliminated.

It can be useful to instruct the receiver to enter the "non-coherent" pulse mode during startup or while recovering from holdover; it reduces the time necessary for phase convergence. After the phase error is reduced the host can instruct the FTS receiver to switch back to "coherent" mode again.

The [UBX-TIM-TOS](#page-444-1) message, when enabled, indicates the actual mode of pulse generation.

Depending on the time pulse generation mode, the time pulse can be forced to be phase aligned to the oscillators. In coherent output mode the phase offset of the oscillator at the rising edge of the time pulse is defined by the phaseOffset field of [UBX-CFG-DOSC](#page-211-2). In "non-coherent" mode this constraint is ignored.

The phase offset is handled differently for both oscillators. Whereas phase lock between the internal oscillator and the time pulse is guaranteed by hardware, in the case of the external oscillator the lock is achieved by software and that lock is therefore the lock behavior is expected to be different.

The frequency, shape and offset of the time pulse can be configured with the [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-286-0) message. Some of the fields are interpreted differently by FTS devices compared to other u-blox receivers. Among others the lockGnssFreq flag is ignored and the time pulse is always aligned to the best synchronization source. Furthermore, switching between the two time pulse frequency and length parameters is not governed by GNSS alone but by the condition selected in the



syncMode field.

- Two delay parameters can be configured using [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-286-0), antCableDelay and userConfigDelay. In an FTS product care should be taken what delays are attributed to which of the delay terms. The antenna cable delay is only relevant when the receiver is following GNSS as reference; the user-configurable delay is applied regardless of the active reference signal.
- In current FTS products only TIMEPULSE 2 can be used for pulse generation. Additionally, just 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz and 2 Hz time pulse output is supported by current FTS products. Other output frequencies may be configured with [UBX-CFG-TP5](#page-286-0) but are not guaranteed to work properly.

## <span id="page-109-0"></span>**26.7 Message transmission time slot reservations on host interfaces**

The firmware provides three message transmission time slots that are aligned to the time pulse output of the receiver. No message is scheduled for transmission in the first slot after the leading edge of the time pulse. The second slot is reserved for the [UBX-TIM-TOS](#page-444-1) message and the third slot is used for outputting other messages. However, any message transmission that was started will be finished before a new message is started.

The time slots can be enabled and configured using [UBX-CFG-TXSLOT](#page-288-1).

When the reference time pulse is disabled or runs at a high frequency it may happen that many or all outgoing messages are lost. Therefore the time slot mechanism should be configured to match the time pulse behavior or disabled altogether.

This mechanism only controls when a message transmission may start and does not guarantee that the message transmission will finish before the end of the corresponding slot. Therefore the end of the last slot should be configured such that the longest enabled message can still be transmitted before the period starts when the receiver must not transmit messages.

The timing of the actual message output is also dependent on the communication interface and its clocking. On the slave interfaces (DDC and SPI) the host must provide clock in all time slots for this feature to work.

## <span id="page-109-1"></span>**26.7.1 Example setup**

Following is an example scenario. The receiver is set up to output a time pulse at a 1 Hz rate. Suppose that the following requirements are given for system integration:

- The TOS message should be output 10 to 50 ms after the time pulse.
- No other message should be output from the leading edge of the time pulse until 50 ms after the time pulse.
- The longest enabled message takes up to 100 ms to transmit through the chosen interface with the configured speed.

Then the time slots are enabled and the three slots are configured to end 10, 50 and 900 ms after the pulse respectively. The following figure indicates time pulses with upwards pointing arrows. Slot 0 (the first one active immediately after the time pulse) is active and thus blocks the transmission of new messages from 100 ms before the time pulse until 10 ms after it. Time slot 1, i.e. the time between 10 and 50 ms after the pulse, is reserved for the top-of-second message. All other messages are output in slot 2.





## <span id="page-110-0"></span>**27 RTK Mode Configuration**



u-blox RTK technology introduces the concept of a reference station and a rover. Using the RTCM3 protocol, the reference station sends corrections to the rover via a communication link enabling the rover to compute its position relative to the reference with high accuracy.

- In the high precision GNSS context, the terms reference station and base station can be used interchangeably.
- The distance between the reference station and the rover is called baseline length.
- The reference station can provide correction to several rovers but the rover cannot concurrently process corrections from several reference stations.

The remainder of this chapter describes how to configure the reference station and the rover. More details about the RTCM3 protocol can be found in the [RTCM3](#page-456-2) section.

## <span id="page-110-1"></span>**27.1 Reference Station Mode Configuration**

Reference Station Mode is a special receiver mode where the receiver uses measurements from all available satellites to broadcast corrections. Configuring a stationary reference station is done in two steps:

- The receiver must be set in Time Mode using the configuration steps described in the [Time](#page-99-1) [Mode Configuration](#page-99-1) section.
- The RTCM3 correction stream must be configured following the rules detailed in the [RTCM3](#page-458-1) [Configuration](#page-458-1) section. Each RTCM message must be individually enabled using [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1).
- By default the reference station will begin operation in standard GNSS mode without any RTCM output. Messages for observations will be streamed as soon as they are configured for output. However messages for the reference station position will only be output when both the reference station is in fixed position mode, and the message is configured for output. As explained in the [Time Mode Configuration](#page-99-1) section, this mode can be directly configured or reached at the end of a successful survey-in.
- The rover will need to have received both reference station observation messages and reference station position messages in order to attempt ambiguity fixes.
- When the reference station is in Time Mode, some error checking is performed on the entered, or surveyed-in, fixed position. If the result of these checks indicates that the fixed position may be incorrect, then a [UBX-INF-WARNING](#page-307-1) message will be sent, with the text "Reference Station position seems incorrect".



## <span id="page-111-0"></span>**27.2 Rover Mode Configuration**

The RTK rover can be configured to work in either of these two differential modes using [UBX-CFG-](#page-211-2)[DGNSS](#page-211-2):

- **RTK fixed:** In this mode, the rover will attempt to fix ambiguities whenever possible.
- **RTK float:** In this mode, the rover will estimate the ambiguities as float but will make no attempts at fixing them.

The time after which old RTCM data will be discarded can be specified using the dgnssTimeout field in [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1).

- By default the rover will begin operation in RTK fixed mode. Upon receiving an RTCM3 correction stream on any of its communication interfaces, the rover will parse the data, apply the correction and, if possible, fix ambiguities. In absence of correction data or if the correction data times out, the rover will operate in standard GNSS mode.
- The time needed to resolve the ambiguity is affected by the baseline length as well as by multipath and satellite visibility at both rover and reference station.

## <span id="page-111-1"></span>**27.3 Moving Baseline RTK Configuration**

The moving baseline (MB) RTK mode differs from the standard RTK mode in that it does not require the reference to be stationary at a known location. In MB RTK mode, both the reference station and rover receivers can move while computing a centimeter-level accurate 3D vector between them. This is ideal for applications where the relative position offset between two moving vehicles is required such as, for example, the follow-me feature on a UAV.

For the sake of conciseness, in the moving baseline RTK context, the reference station and rover receivers are referred to as MB reference and MB rover, respectively.

## <span id="page-111-2"></span>**27.3.1 MB Reference Configuration**

Configuring a receiver to operate in MB reference mode is done in two steps:

- The receiver must be set in Time Mode disabled using the configuration message [UBX-CFG-](#page-282-1)[TMODE3](#page-282-1).
- The RTCM3 correction stream must be configured following the rules detailed in the [RTCM3](#page-458-1) [Configuration](#page-458-1) section. Each RTCM message must be individually enabled using [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1).

If the MB reference moves, then its position changes over time. To ensure that the baseline is as accurate as possible:

- The MB reference position must be sent for each epoch the MB reference observations are sent.
- The MB reference and rover must use the same navigation update rate.

## <span id="page-111-3"></span>**27.3.2 MB Rover Configuration**

As in the standard RTK mode, it is possible to configure the MB rover to operate in RTK fixed or RTK float using the [UBX-CFG-DGNSS](#page-211-2) message.



By default the MB rover will begin operation in RTK fixed mode.

As discussed in the [Moving Baseline Expected Performance](#page-112-0) section, RTCM corrections can only be extrapolated over a few seconds when both reference and rover receivers are moving. Therefore, any dgnssTimeout value configured using the [UBX-CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1) message will be ignored by the MB rover.



## <span id="page-112-0"></span>**27.3.3 Expected Performance**

While the MB RTK solution aims at estimating the relative position with centimeter-level accuracy, the absolute position of each receiver is expected to be known with a standard GNSS accuracy of a few meters. Additionally, the performance of the MB RTK solution is limited by the following:

- A moving reference receiver typically experiences worse GNSS tracking than a static reference receiver in an open-sky environment and therefore the MB RTK performance may be degraded.
- The MB rover can only compute an optimal MB RTK solution if the time-matched RTCM observation and position messages are received within a predefined time limit. The MB rover will wait up to **700 ms** for messages before falling back to an extrapolated MB RTK solution. The MB rover will extrapolate the MB reference observations and/or position for up to **3 s** before falling back to standard GNSS operation.
- The achievable update rate of the MB RTK solution is limited by the communication link latency. As a rule of thumb, the communication link latency should be about half the desired navigation update period. If it exceeds 700 ms, the MB rover will not be able to compute an MB RTK solution, even at 1 Hz.
- Since the MB rover must wait for time-matched RTCM corrections from the MB RTK reference to compute its position, the overall latency of the MB RTK solution will be the sum of the communication link latency plus the MB RTK computation time.
- When falling back to standard GNSS operation, the MB rover will automatically adjust the accuracy and status flag information contained in the messages listed in the [RTCM3 Output](#page-459-0) section.
- Upon recovering the RTCM correction stream, the MB rover will automatically try to revert to MB RTK operation.

## <span id="page-112-1"></span>**28 Automotive Dead Reckoning (ADR)**

This feature is only available with the [ADR](#page-112-1) products.

## <span id="page-112-2"></span>**28.1 Introduction**

u-blox solutions for Automotive Dead Reckoning (ADR) allow high-accuracy positioning in places with poor or no GNSS coverage. ADR is based on Sensor Fusion Dead Reckoning (SFDR) technology, which combines GNSS measurements with those from external sensors.

ADR solutions use the messages of the [External Sensor Fusion \(ESF\) class.](#page-291-0)

## <span id="page-112-3"></span>**28.2 Solution Types**

## <span id="page-112-4"></span>**28.2.1 GAWT: Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Wheel Tick Solution**

The GAWT solution combines data from wheel-tick sensors, accelerometers and gyroscopes to compute a fused navigation solution. There are several different possible GAWT variants, depending on which sensors are available. The minimum set of sensors required for computing GAWT solutions is:

- A speed/distance sensor providing a single wheel tick (sometimes called a speed tick) or speed measurement;
- A z-axis gyroscope measuring the vehicle yaw rate;



â¢ An x-axis accelerometer measuring the vehicle forward-backward acceleration.

The solution may be further improved by using the following additional sensors:

- A 3-axis accelerometer can improve the height estimation accuracy;
- If the z-axis gyroscope is not aligned to the vehicle vertical axis then a 3-axis gyroscope with IMU-mount misalignment configuration ([UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1)) will allow the receiver to re-create the output of a correctly aligned z-axis gyroscope. This will result in improved planimetric accuracy compared to a single mis-aligned z-axis gyroscope.
- A temperature sensor can be used to compensate for temperature-dependent gyroscope errors. Depending on the sensor specification and temperature variation, this can significantly improve performance during periods of dead reckoning (see [Gyroscope Configuration](#page-138-0) section for more details).

To operate ADR products in GAWT mode, the following tasks need to be completed:

- **Sensor configuration** (only for chipset products): the [Wheel-Tick/Speed Sensor](#page-118-0), the [Gyroscope](#page-138-0) and the [Accelerometers](#page-137-1) settings must be set up, and the [Sensor Time Tagging](#page-140-4) must be properly configured. If the sensors data are properly fed to the receiver and configuration is successful, the sensors should appear in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message.
- In ADR module products (NEO-M8L), the receiver is ready to operate in ADR (GAWT) navigation mode (this note is only valid in [protocol versions 15.01+](#page-15-2)).
- **Installation configuration**: the [IMU-mount Misalignment](#page-133-4) should be accurately configured for the receiver to achieve fusion solution.

Once these steps are completed, the firmware is ready to be operated in ADR GAWT navigation mode.

## <span id="page-113-0"></span>**28.3 Installation Configuration**

If the GNSS antenna is placed at a significant distance from the receiver, position offsets can be introduced which might affect the accuracy of the navigation solution. In order to compensate for the position offset advanced configurations can be applied. Contact u-blox support for more information on advanced configurations.

## <span id="page-113-1"></span>**28.3.1 IMU-mount Alignment**

(This feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01\)](#page-15-2).

The default assumption is that the IMU-frame and the installation-frame have the same orientation (i.e. all axes are parallel). If this assumption is not valid, the positioning solution can be degraded if the IMU-mount misalignment angles are small (typically few degrees) or can even fail in case of large (tens of degrees) IMU-mount misalignments. Therefore, it is important to correctly configure the IMU-mount misalignment settings by using the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message.

This section describes how IMU-mount misalignment angles, i.e. the angles which rotate the installation-frame to the IMU-frame, can be configured using the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section below).

If the IMU-mount misalignment angles are unknown, they can be estimated during a dedicated initialization drive through an automatic alignment procedure. This is described in the [Automatic](#page-137-2) [IMU-Mount Alignment](#page-137-2) section below.

In u-blox module products containing an internal IMU (e.g. NEO-M8U modules), the IMU-



mount misalignment angles are estimated automatically by default (see [Automatic](#page-137-2) [IMU-Mount Alignment](#page-137-2) section below for further details).

## **28.3.1.1 Definitions**

The IMU-mount misalignment angles are defined as follows:

- The transformation from the installation-frame to the IMU-frame is described by three Euler angles about the installation-frame axes denoted as IMU-mount roll, IMU-mount pitch and IMUmount yaw angles. All three angles are referred as the IMU-mount misalignment angles.
- There is a single IMU-mount misalignment configuration that applies to both gyroscopes and accelerometers, so these sensors must be aligned with each other if both types are present.

## **28.3.1.2 User-defined IMU-mount Alignment**

The user can configure manually some IMU-mount roll, pitch and yaw angles using the [UBX-CFG-](#page-213-1)[ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message. The values that should be set in the configuration message are the Euler angles required to rotate the installation-frame to the IMU-frame. The IMU-mount yaw rotation should be performed first, then the IMU-mount pitch and finally the IMU-mount roll. At each stage, the rotation is around the appropriate axis of the transformed installation-frame, meaning that the order of the rotation sequence is important (see figure below).



If there is only a single IMU-mount misalignment angle then it may be measured as shown in the three examples below.





In order to prevent significant degradation of the positioning solution the IMU-mount misalignment angles should be configured with an accuracy of at least 5 degrees.

The list below describes in details how the fields in the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) message must be interpreted with respect to example illustrated in the figure above:

- **User-defined IMU-mount yaw angle**: The IMU-mount yaw angle (yaw) corresponds to the rotation around the installation-frame z-axis (vertical) required for aligning the installationframe to the IMU-frame (yaw = 344.0 deg if the IMU-mount misalignment is composed of a single rotation around the installation-frame z-axis, i.e. with no IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount pitch rotation).
- **User-defined IMU-mount pitch angle**: The IMU-mount pitch angle (pitch) corresponds to the rotation around the installation-frame y-axis required for aligning the installation-frame to the IMU-frame (pitch = 26.5 deg if the IMU-mount alignment is composed of a single rotation around the installation-frame y-axis, i.e. with no IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount yaw rotation).
- **User-defined IMU-mount roll angle**: The IMU-mount roll angle (roll) corresponds to the rotation around the installation-frame x-axis required for aligning the installation-frame to the IMU-frame (roll = -23.5 deg if the IMU-mount misalignment is composed of a single rotation around installation-frame x-axis, i.e. with no IMU-mount pitch and IMU-mount yaw rotation).



If automatic alignment is turned-on (see [Automatic IMU-mount Alignment](#page-137-2) section), the angles obtained by polling [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) are still the user-defined angles which do not correspond to the result of the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine as output in [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) (see [IMU-mount Misalignment Angles Output](#page-145-1) section for more details).

## **28.3.1.3 Automatic IMU-mount Alignment**

The automatic IMU-mount alignment engine estimates automatically the IMU-mount roll, pitch and yaw angles. It requires an initialization phase during which no INS/GNSS fusion can be achieved (see [Filter Modes](#page-141-0) section for further details). The progress of the automatic alignment initialization can be monitored with the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message, and/or with the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message providing more details. When the vehicle is subject to sufficient dynamics (i.e. left and right turns during a normal drive), the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine will estimate the IMU-mount misalignment angles which have the same meaning as defined in the [Definitions](#page-134-1) section, regardless whether the user did or not enter manually some IMU-mount misalignment angles (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section). Once the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine has sufficient confidence in the estimated initial IMU-mount misalignment angles, the IMU-mount misalignment angles initialization phase is completed. The raw accelerometer and gyroscope data (i.e. the IMU observations) are then compensated for IMU-mount misalignment and sensor fusion can be done. The resulting IMU-mount misalignment angles are output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message.

For automatic IMU-mount alignemnt a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer is required (only valid in [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2)).

## **28.3.1.3.1 Enabling/Disabling Automatic IMU-mount Alignment**

The user can activate/deactivate the automatic IMU-mount alignment by setting the doAutoMntAlg bit in the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message.

If automatic IMU-mount alignment is deactivated while aligning, the estimated misalignment angles that were available at deactivation time are used (only if they were initialized, see next section). If automatic IMU-mount alignment is re-activated, alignment is pursued by starting from the state where deactivation happened (only valid in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)).

## **28.3.1.4 Limitation with Single-Axis Gyroscope**

Gyroscope-mount misalignment is only supported when a three-axis gyroscope is available. In case of a single-axis gyroscope, the sensor should be physically aligned along the installationframe z-axis. This is needed to avoid a scale factor error which will affect the accuracy of the output due to the two missing gyroscopes.

### **28.4.2.2 Temperature Compensation**

Gyroscope sensors generally exhibit a temperature-dependent bias that varies from unit to unit. To help compensate for this variation the receiver builds up a table of gyroscope bias versus temperature measurements which are often available from the gyroscope sensor itself. This is particularly valuable to dead-reckoning-only navigation after the vehicle has been left for some time in parking garage.

The gyroscope temperature compensation engine has the following settings:

- **Gyroscope RMS threshold above which temperature table is not updated**: The gyroscope temperature-dependent bias is only updated if the measured gyroscope angular rate RMS is below the given threshold. This avoids artificially high estimates of the gyroscope temperaturedependent bias from transient events such as vehicle engine starts or nearby heavy construction. This threshold can be configured in the gyroRmsThdl field and is shared with the sensor accuracy estimation engine (see above);
- **Temperature-dependent bias table saving rate**: Gyroscope temperature compensation data are saved to non-volatile storage at intervals that can be configured by the tcTableSaveRate field.

The gyroscope temperature-dependent bias table is revised under the following conditions:

- The vehicle is stationary (without wheel-tick measurements or at zero speed);
- The RMS of the measured gyroscope angular rates and accelerometer specific forces is below a given threshold (see above);
- Turntable mode is not engaged (only for ADR products, see [Ferry and Turntable Modes](#page-14-0) section);
- Gyroscope temperature compensation is effective if the gyroscope(s) exhibits repeatable characteristics with temperature and is not unduly affected by external



factors (such as supply voltage or mechanical stress).

## **28.4.3.2 Sensor Types**

u-blox products support sensors delivering the following types of data:

- **Relative wheel-tick data**: If the wheel-tick sensor delivers relative wheel-tick counts (i.e. wheeltick count since the previous measurement), the wtCountMax value must be set to 0.
- **Absolute wheel-tick data**: If the wheel-tick sensor delivers absolute wheel-tick counts (i.e. wheel-tick count since startup at time tag 0) that always increase, regardless of driving forward or backward (driving direction is indicated separately, see the [ESF Measurement Data](#page-149-0) section), the wtCountMax value must be set to any non-zero value.
- By default, the maximum absolute wheel-tick counter value is automatically estimated by the receiver for a maximum counter value that can be represented as a 2^N value. Other maximum counter values must be manually configured. For example, a wtCountMax=1024 roll-over value would be automatically estimated, but a wtCountMax=1 000 must be configured. The maximum counter value is configured by setting the autoWtCountMaxOff bit and setting the wtCountMax value to the upper threshold of the absolute wheel-tick sensor count before starting again from zero (roll-over). (This note is only valid in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)).
- If absolute wheel-tick data are used, the upper threshold towards which the absolute wheel-tick sensor counts ticks before starting again from zero (roll-over) must be configured in the wtCountMax field (This note is only valid in [protocol versions less than](#page-15-2) [19](#page-15-2)).
- **Speed data**: The sensor delivers speed data in meters per second (data type 11 in [ESF-MEAS](#page-149-0)). Data coming from this sensor type can only be delivered to the receiver via serial port (software interface).
- If speed data but no absolute or relative wheel-tick data are detected, the receiver automatically uses the speed data without the need of reconfiguring the useWtSpeed bit. This behaviour can be deactivated by setting the autoUseWtSpeedOff bit and by manually setting or clearing the useWtSpeed bit. If wheel-tick data (or both wheel-tick and speed data) are detected on the software interface, the receiver uses the data type (by default wheel-tick data) corresponding to the configured useWtSpeed bit value (This note is only valid in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)).
- To make the receiver interpret incoming speed data (data type 11 in [ESF-MEAS](#page-149-0)) instead of the single wheel-tick data (data type 10 in [ESF-MEAS](#page-149-0)) on the software interface, the useWtSpeed bit must be set (This note is only valid in [protocol versions less than 19](#page-15-2)).
- It is strongly recommended to use absolute wheel-tick sensors in order to ensure robust measurement processing even after sensor failures or outages.



## **28.4.3.3 Interface**

Wheel-tick/speed data can be delivered to u-blox products via the following interfaces:

- **Hardware interface**: Some u-blox products (e.g. NEO-M8L modules) have a pin dedicated to analog wheel-tick signal input and a pin dedicated to the wheel-tick direction signal. The receiver checks for analog wheel-tick signal input and will use it if the pin is correctly connected, the useWtPin flag is set (this is the default configuration for products having a pin dedicated to analog wheel-tick signal input), and the analog direction pin polarity is configured.
- The analog direction signal polarity is automatically detected by the receiver. To manually configure the polarity, automatic detection must be turned-off by setting the autoDirPinPolOff bit and the polarity must be defined in the dirPinPol field (This note is only valid in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)).
- The analog direction signal polarity must be configured in the dirPinPol field (This note is only valid in [protocol versions less than 19](#page-15-2)).

Double edge counting can be enabled via the cntBothEdges flag. It can increase performance with low resolution wheel ticks. It does not fit all kinds of wheel tick signals. It **must not** be used with signals that are not generated with approximately 50% duty signal as it would worsen performance.

- **Software interface**: The sensor data are delivered to the receiver on the serial port (software interface) in the form of [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) messages. Serial port can be configured for UART using the [UBX-CFG-PRT](#page-257-1) message. For products with a hardware interface for analog wheel-tick signal input (e.g. NEO-M8L modules), the useWtPin bit must not be set if sensor data delivered via serial port should be used (only in [protocol versions less than 19](#page-15-2)).
- By default, the receiver automatically switches-off the hardware interface (i.e. ignores the useWtPin flag) if wheel-tick/speed data are detected on the software interface. Therefore data coming from the software interface will be prioritized over data coming from the hardware interface. To disable the automatic use of data detected on the software interface, the autoSoftwareWtOff bit must be set (This note is only valid in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)).

## **28.4.3.4 Settings**

The following sensor settings can be configured:

- **Sampling Frequency**: The wheel-tick/speed data sampling frequency (wtFrequency) should be provided with an accuracy of about 10%. If not provided, it is automatically determined during initialization phase: this requires a consistent data rate and can take several minutes. Once initialized, the sampling frequency will be stored in non-volatile storage. For optimal navigation performance, the standard wheel-tick/speed input at 10 [Hz] is recommended.
- **Accuracy**: The wheel-tick/speed data accuracy (wtAccuracy) is defined as the standard deviation under normal operating conditions. Wheel-tick/speed data are corrupted by noise from sources inherent to the sensor. The accuracy is automatically determined and will then be stored in non-volatile storage.
- **Latency**: For best positioning performance, the latency of the wheel-tick/speed data (wtLatenc y) should be given as accurately as possible (to within at least 10 ms). If not provided, the wheeltick/speed data latency is assumed zero. More details about latency can be found in the [Sensor](#page-140-4) [Time Tagging](#page-140-4) section.
- **Quantization error**: If absolute/relative wheel-tick data are used and the tick data do not contain



raw tick counts (e.g. if the tick data is a distance), the quantization error can be defined in the wtQuantError or quantError fields. The quantization error can be calculated as 2\*Pi\*R / T with R the wheel radius, T the number of ticks per wheel rotation. If the quantization error is not provided, it is automatically initialized by the receiver.

- **Sensor dead band**: Some wheel-tick or speed sensors have a dead band which is the value below which no speed is reported. If this is the case, the value needs to be configured in the speedDeadBand field. However, the performance will still be degraded compared to having no dead band. If not provided, the receiver assumes the sensor has no dead band.
- **Speed data accuracy**: If speed data are used, the speed data accuracy can be set in the wtQuantError or quantError field. If not provided, the speed data accuracy is automatically initialized by the receiver.
- **Scale factors**: If the coarse scale factors are not configured by the user (wtFactor, factorR, factorF), they are estimated automatically during initialization (see [Initialization Mode](#page-141-1) section for more details).
- **Combination of multiple rear wheel-ticks**: The receiver can be configured to use the combined rear wheel-ticks rather than the single-tick. It is recommended to use combined rear wheel-ticks if available, as they are often of higher quality than the single-ticks. If DWT, GWT and GAWT solutions are configured concurrently, combineTicks must be set to provide a consistent configuration. If combineTicks is set, the wheel-ticks basis settings (maximum value of the wheel-ticks counter, wheel-ticks sensor frequency, scale factors and quantization error) must reflect the properties of the rear wheel-ticks.

## <span id="page-120-0"></span>**28.4.4 Sensor Time Tagging**

In order to achieve optimal performance with the fusion solution it is essential to determine the epoch in the receiver time frame when the external sensor measurements were generated. This may be done in one of the following ways:

- First Byte Reception: reception time of first byte of [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message
- Time Mark on External Input: reception time of time mark signal sent to external input

The latency of the sensor data is the time between when the sensor measurement was taken and the detection at the receiver of either the first byte of the [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message or the preprocessor's time mark, depending on the timing approach chosen. Increased latency reduces the navigation performance.

In ADR, the latency can be set by using the latency, wtLatency, gyroLatency and accelLatency parameters in the appropriate configuration message, as discussed in the [Automotive Dead](#page-112-1) [Reckoning \(ADR\)](#page-112-1) chapter.

In UDR, the latency can be set by using the latency parameter in the appropriate sensor configuration message, as discussed in the [Untethered Dead Reckoning \(UDR\)](#page-133-1) chapter.

## **28.4.4.1 First Byte Reception**

The easiest way to determine the sensor measurement generation time is to have the GNSS receiver assume the time of reception of the first byte of the [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message (minus a constant configured latency) to be the time of sensor measurement. This approach is the simplest to implement, but [Time Mark on External Input](#page-139-1) can yield better latency control and compensation.





## **28.4.4.2 Time Mark on External Input**

In this case, the preprocessor unit generating the measurements sends a signal to the EXTINT input of the GNSS receiver, marking the moment of measurement generation. The subsequent [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message is then flagged accordingly, and the measurements in the message will be assumed to have been generated at the time of external signal reception (minus a constant configured latency). This approach is the preferred solution, but it can be difficult to realize an exact analog time signal for the preprocessor unit.



## **28.4.4.3 Sensor Time Tagging Configuration**

The receiver requires external sensor packets time tagged in seconds.

The external sensor time tagging for WT can be configured in the [UBX-CFG-ESFWT](#page-215-2) (not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01](#page-15-2)).

The following sensor time tagging settings need to be specified:

- **Sensor time tag scale factor to seconds:** (timeTagFactor): This parameters converts the sensor time tags from their original time unit into the required seconds. For example if the IMU raw packets are time-tagged in milliseconds, the scale factor for converting one millisecond into one seconds is 0.001.
- **Sensor time tag maximum value:** (timeTagMax): External sensor time tags are encoded in different data types (signed/unsigned, varying number of bytes) which might vary across sensor types. For example if the IMU raw packet's time-tag field is encoded into an unsigned long integer (4 bytes), the maximum possible time-tag value is 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFFin hexadecimal).



## <span id="page-122-0"></span>**28.5 ADR System Configuration**

## <span id="page-122-1"></span>**28.5.1 Enabling/Disabling Fusion Filter**

The ADR fusion filter can be turned off by means of the useAdr bit in the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) configuration message. If fusion is turned off, the receiver outputs a GNSS-only solution.

## <span id="page-122-2"></span>**28.5.2 Recommended Configuration**

For an optimum ADR navigation performance, the recommended general configuration is the following:

â¢ **Navigation Rate**: the standard navigation solution update rate of 1 Hz (see [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1) message) is recommended. The wheel tick quantization error is a limiting factor when using high frequency updates. This means that navigation rates higher than 1 Hz may result in lower position accuracies.

Reconsider the enabled messages and features (e.g logging) at higher navigation rates to meet CPU load, memory and interface bandwidth constraints (Valid in [protocol](#page-15-2) [versions 19.2](#page-15-2)).

## <span id="page-122-3"></span>**28.6 Operation**

This section describes how the ADR receiver operates.

## <span id="page-122-4"></span>**28.6.1 Fusion Filter Modes**

The fusion filter operates in different modes which are output in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message.

The table below summarizes the different fusion filter modes with the associated tasks the receiver is doing.

More details about each fusion mode are given in the following sections.



## **28.6.1.1 Initialization Mode**

The purpose of the initialization phase is to estimate all unknown parameters which are required for achieving fusion. The initialization phase is triggered after a receiver cold start or a filter reset in case of fusion failure. The receiver is in initialization mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-](#page-296-1)[ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is 0:INITIALIZING. In this case the required sensor calibration status (cal ibStatus) is flagged as 0: NOT CALIBRATED and the navigation solution output during initialization is based on GNSS solely.

The initialization phase comprises the following internal steps whose status is published in the initStatus field of the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message:

- **IMU initialization:** Unknown crucial IMU parameters such as sensor sampling frequency are estimated during initialization. As long as all required IMU parameters are not initialized, the status of the IMU initialization (imuInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-](#page-296-1)[STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Moreover, the required sensor calibration statuses (calibStatus) are flagged as 0:NOT CALIBRATED in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Note that if the user configured all required sensor settings, this step is skipped and IMU initialization is flagged as 2: INITIALIZED (not supported in [protocol versions less than 19](#page-15-2)).
- **IMU-mount alignment initialization:** If automatic IMU-mount alignment is enabled (see the [Automatic IMU-mount Alignment Configuration](#page-137-2) section), initial IMU-mount roll, IMU-mount pitch and IMU-mount yaw angles need to be estimated. For that, good GNSS signal reception as well as sufficient vehicle dynamics (i.e. a series of left and right turns during a normal drive) need to be at hand. As long as the IMU-mount alignment is not initialized, the status of the IMUmount alignment (mntAlgStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the IMU-mount alignment status is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED. If no IMU-mount alignment is required, the IMU-mount alignment is flagged as 0:OFF. A detailed description of the automatic IMU-mount alignment operation can be found in the [Automatic](#page-145-0) [IMU-mount Alignment Operation](#page-145-0) section (not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01](#page-15-2)).
- **INS initialization:** Before entering fusion mode, the initial vehicle position, velocity and especially attitude (vehicle roll, pitch heading angles) needs to be known with sufficient accuracy. This is achieved during INS initialization phase (which comprises an INS coarse alignment step) using GNSS. As long as the fusion filter isn't initialized, the status of the INS initialization (insInitSt atus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the INS initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED (not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01](#page-15-2)).

This section is valid only for [protocol versions less than 19.2](#page-15-2)

â¢ **Wheel-tick sensor initialization (ADR products only):** Before entering fusion mode, some parameters like initial wheel-tick factors need to be estimated with sufficient accuracy. This is achieved during wheel-tick sensor initialization phase using GNSS. As long as the wheel-tick parameters are not initialized, the status of the wheel-tick initialization (wtInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the wheel-tick sensor initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED and the parameters are stored in non-volatile storage. If no wheel-tick data are required (in UDR products), the wheel-tick initialization is flagged as 0:OFF (only valid in [protocol versions less than 19.2](#page-15-2)).

This section is valid only for [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2)

â¢ **Wheel-tick sensor initialization (ADR products only):** Solution enters fusion mode (fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is on 1:FUSION), even when wheel-tick is not yet initialized, following a [UDR](#page-133-1) mode approach. WT sensor parameters, like initial wheel-tick



factors, are estimated in parallel and are used once estimated with sufficient accuracy. As long as the wheel-tick parameters are not initialized, the status of the wheel-tick initialization (wtIni tStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the wheel-tick sensor initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED, WT data are used by the filter and the parameters are stored in non-volatile storage. If no wheel-tick data are required (in UDR products), the wheel-tick initialization is flagged as 0:OFF (only valid in [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2)).

- Beside the wheel-tick factors, other parameters like direction pin polarity are initialized if requested.
- **Sensor error (e.g. missing data) detected:** Sensor timeout of more than 500ms will trigger an INS re-initialization (not supported in [protocol versions less than 19.2\)](#page-15-2).

Note that initialization phase requires good GNSS signal conditions as well as periods during which vehicle is stationary and moving (including turns). Once all required initialization steps are achieved, fusion mode is triggered and the calibration phase begins.

## **28.6.1.2 Fusion Mode**

Once initialization phase is achieved, the receiver enters navigation mode. The receiver is in fusion mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is set on 1:FUSION. The fusion filter then starts to compute combined GNSS/dead-reckoning fixes (fused solutions) and to calibrate the sensors required for computing the fused navigation solution (used bit set). This is the case when the sensor calibration status (calibStatus) is flagged as 1:CALIBRATING. As soon as the calibration reaches a status where optimal fusion performance can be expected, the sensor calibration status is flagged as 2/3:CALIBRATED.

## **28.6.1.3 Suspended Fusion Mode**

Sensor fusion can be temporarily suspended in cases where no fused solution should/can be computed. The receiver is in the temporarily disabled fusion mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is set on 2:SUSPENDED. In this case, the receiver computes a GNSSonly solution.

Fusion is suspended if:

- One or several sensors deliver erroneous data or no data at all, the fusion is suspended during the sensor failure period. The receiver automatically recovers once the affected sensor(s) is/are back to normal operation (only supported in [protocol versions less than 19.2\)](#page-15-2).
- The vehicle is detected to be on a ferry where wheel-ticks do not detect any displacement (in ADR products only).

## **28.6.1.4 Disabled Fusion Mode**

Sensor fusion can be permanently switched off in cases where recurrent fusion failures happen or user turned off manually fusion. The receiver is in the permanently disabled fusion mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is set on 3:DISABLED. In such a case, the receiver computes a GNSS-only solution.

Fusion is permanently disabled in the following cases:

- If the fusion filter was manually turned off by the user (useAdr bit in the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) message is not set).
- If significantly wrong installation or filter parameters causing filter divergence are sent to the receiver.



â¢ If the fusion filter encountered too many errors.

An IMU-mount alignment error is output in the error field in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message.

## <span id="page-125-0"></span>**28.6.2 Accelerated Initialization and Calibration Procedure**

This section describes how to perform fast initialization and calibration of the ADR receiver for the purpose of evaluation.

The duration of the initialization phase mostly depends on the quality of the GNSS signals and the dynamics encountered by the vehicle. Therefore the car should be driven to an open and flat area like an empty open-sky parking area for example. The initialization and calibration drive should contain phases where the car is stopped during a few minutes (with engine turned on), phases where the car is doing normal left and right turns and phases where speed is above 30 km/h under good GNSS reception conditions.

The initialization time required for reaching fused navigation mode can be shortened by following the procedure in the order described in the table below.

| Phase              | Procedure                              | Indicator of Success                      |

## **Accelerated Initialization Procedure**



Once initialization is completed, the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message switches to 1:FUSION, combined GNSS/dead-reckoning fixes (fused solutions) are output and the sensors used in the navigation filter start to get calibrated. Calibration is a continuous process running in the background and directly impacting the navigation solution quality.

The calibration time required for reaching optimal ADR navigation performance can be shortened by following the procedure described in the table below.

| Phase           | Procedure                            | Indicator of Success                |  |

## **Accelerated Calibration Procedure**

Note that the calibration status (calibStatus in [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message) of some used sensors might fall back to 1:CALIBRATING if the receiver is operated in challenging conditions. In such a case, fused navigation solution uncertainty increases until optimal conditions are observed again for re-calibrating the sensors.

The fused navigation performance quality might also depend on how well the gyroscope temperature compensation table is populated. The table gradually fills in while the vehicle is stationary and by observing gyroscope biases at different temperatures. Therefore the quality of the gyroscope temperature compensation depends on how many temperature bins could be observed while the vehicle was stationary and on the duration of observation for each bin.

## <span id="page-126-0"></span>**28.6.3 Automatic IMU-mount Alignment**

(This feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01\)](#page-15-2).

## **28.6.3.1 Alignment Solution Output**

The IMU-mount misalignment angles are output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message. They have the following meaning:

â¢ **IMU-mount yaw angle**: During IMU-mount yaw angle initialization (status field is equal to 2),



the published angle (yaw) corresponds to the current estimated value but is not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations. After initialization (status field is equal or higher than 3), the published angle corresponds to the estimated value and is applied for rotating the IMU observations. If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angle corresponds to the IMU-mount yaw angle configured by the user (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and is applied for rotating the IMU observations.

- **IMU-mount pitch angle**: During IMU-mount pitch angle initialization (status field is equal to 1), the published angle (pitch) corresponds to the current estimated value but is not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations. After initialization (status field is equal or higher than 3), the published angle corresponds to the estimated value and is applied for rotating the IMU observations. If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angle corresponds to the IMU-mount pitch angle configured by the user (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and is applied for rotating the IMU observations.
- **IMU-mount roll angle**: During IMU-mount roll angle initialization (status field is equal to 1), the published angle (roll) corresponds to the current estimated value but is not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations. After initialization (status field is equal or higher than 3), the published angle corresponds to the estimated value and is applied for rotating the IMU observations. If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angle corresponds to the IMU-mount roll angle configured by the user (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and is applied for rotating the IMU observations.
- If user-defined IMU-mount misalignment angles were configured by the user using [UBX-](#page-213-1)[CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and automatic IMU-mount alignment is active, the angles output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message still correspond to the definition given above: they represent the full rotation required for transforming IMU data from installation-frame to IMU-frame. This means that the output misalignment angles are computed from the composed rotation of the user-defined rotation and the internally-estimated rotation.

## **28.6.3.2 Alignment Progress**

The progress of the automatic IMU-mount alignment can be monitored by checking the status field in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message (see the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message description for the meaning of the values output in the status field).

- **IMU-mount roll/pitch angle initialization ongoing**: The alignment engine is initializing the IMUmount roll and pitch angles (status is 1). Both angles can only be initialized if vehicle encounters left and right turns (as occurring during a normal drive).
- **IMU-mount yaw angle initialization ongoing**: The alignment engine is initializing the IMU-mount yaw angle (status is 2). IMU-mount yaw angle can only be initialized once IMU-mount roll and pitch angles are initialized and if vehicle encounters left and right turns (as occurring during a normal drive).
- **IMU-mount misalignment angles are initialized** (only supported in [protocol versions 15.01 to 17\)](#page-15-2): The alignment engine has sufficient confidence in all IMU-mount misalignment angles and validates their use for compensating the accelerometer and gyroscope data, i.e. fused navigation solutions can be computed (status is 3).
- **IMU-mount alignment coarse calibration ongoing** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2): Once initialized (status is 3), the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine has sufficient confidence in all IMU-mount misalignment angles and validates their use for compensating the



accelerometer and gyroscope data (fused navigation solutions can be computed). The engine keeps filtering the IMU-mount misalignment angles every time the observed vehicle dynamics allows for it.

â¢ **IMU-mount alignment fine calibration ongoing** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)): Once the IMU-mount misalignment angles are estimated with a good accuracy, the automatic IMUmount alignment engine becomes more conservative in updating the IMU-mount misalignment angles (status is 4).

## **28.6.3.3 Alignment Errors**

The following errors might be output in the error bitfield of the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message:

- **IMU-mount misalignment angle error** (only supported in [protocol versions 15.01 to 17\)](#page-15-2): If the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount misalignment angles (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the error bit 0 in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message is set.
- **IMU-mount roll/pitch angle error** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)): If the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount roll and/or IMU-mount pitch misalignment angles (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the error bit 0 in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message is set.
- **IMU-mount yaw angle error** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2): If the automatic IMUmount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount yaw misalignment angle (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the error bit 1 in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message is set.
- **Euler Angle singularity ('gimbal-lock') error** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)): The Euler angle singularity error bit 2 is set when the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine detects an installation where the IMU-frame is misaligned in such a way that a degree of freedom is lost when two IMU-mount misalignment (Euler) angles begin to describe the same rotations (or axes). This happens for example with an IMU-mount misalignment of +/- 90 degrees around the IMU-mount pitch axis, where IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount yaw cannot be distinguished from each other. In such a case, these IMU-mount misalignment angles start to heavily fluctuate with time due to the mathematical singularity occurring at these points, meaning that the IMUmount misalignment angles output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) are not stable in time. Note however that each individual set of IMU-mount misalignment angles output in such a case still describes the correct rotation. Moreover, the internal rotation applied for aligning the IMU readings doesn't suffer from this singularity issue and optimal fusion can still be achieved.

## <span id="page-128-0"></span>**28.6.4 Navigation Output**

## <span id="page-128-1"></span>**28.6.4.1 Local-level North-East-Down (NED) Frame**

The local-level frame is a geodetic frame with following features:

- The origin (O) is a point on the Earth surface;
- The x-axis points to North;
- the y-axis points to East;
- the z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.

The frame is referred to as North-East-Down (NED) since its axes are aligned with the North, East and Down directions.



## <span id="page-129-0"></span>**28.6.4.2 Vehicle-Frame**

The vehicle-frame is a right-handed 3D Cartesian frame rigidly connected with the vehicle and is used to determine the attitude of the vehicle with respect to the local-level frame. It has the following features:

- The origin (O) is the [VRP](#page-14-0) in [protocol versions less than 19.2,](#page-15-2) otherwise, is the origin of the IMU instrumental frame;
- The x-axis points towards the front of the vehicle;
- the y-axis points towards the right of the vehicle;
- the z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.

## **28.6.4.3 Vehicle Position and Velocity Output**

The position and velocity information is output in several messages like [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) for example. In [protocol versions less than 19.2,](#page-15-2) position and velocity computed by the ADR navigation filter are referenced to the [VRP](#page-14-0). For [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2), position and velocity are referenced to the origin of the IMU instrumental frame.

## <span id="page-129-1"></span>**28.6.4.4 Vehicle Attitude Output**

#### (Only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2).

The transformation between the [vehicle-frame](#page-129-0) and the [local-level frame](#page-128-1) is described by three attitude angles about the local-level axes denoted as vehicle roll, vehicle pitch and vehicle heading. All three angles are referred as vehicle attitude and are illustrated in the figure below:





The order of the sequence of rotations around the navigation axes defining the vehicle attitude matrix in terms of vehicle attitude angles is illustrated below:



$$
\mathbf{C}_X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\phi) & \sin(\phi) \\ 0 & -\sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi) \end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{C}_Y = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & 0 & -\sin(\theta) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{C}_Z = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\psi) & \sin(\psi) & 0 \\ -\sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\mathbf{C}_{b}^{n} = \mathbf{C}_{Z}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{C}_{Y}^{T} \cdot \mathbf{C}_{X}^{T}
$$
\n
$$
= \begin{bmatrix}\n\cos(\theta) \cos(\psi) & \sin(\phi) \sin(\theta) \cos(\psi) - \cos(\phi) \sin(\psi) & \cos(\phi) \sin(\theta) \cos(\psi) + \sin(\phi) \sin(\psi) \\
\cos(\theta) \sin(\psi) & \sin(\phi) \sin(\theta) \sin(\psi) + \cos(\phi) \cos(\psi) & \cos(\phi) \sin(\theta) \sin(\psi) - \sin(\phi) \cos(\psi) \\
-\sin(\theta) & \sin(\phi) \cos(\theta) & \cos(\theta)\n\end{bmatrix}
$$

Note that in this figure the body-frame corresponds to the [vehicle-frame](#page-129-0).

The vehicle attitude is output in the [UBX-NAV-ATT](#page-372-1) message. The message provides all three angles together with their accuracy estimates.

Roll angle estimation only supported in [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2).

## **28.6.4.5 Vehicle Dynamics Output**

## (Only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2).

The [UBX-ESF-INS](#page-292-1) message outputs information about vehicle dynamics provided by the INS: compensated vehicle angular rates and compensated vehicle accelerations. The acceleration data is free of any gravitational acceleration. Its accuracy is directly dependent on the filter attitude estimation accuracy.

Compensated vehicle dynamics information is output with respect to the [vehicle-frame](#page-129-0).

The message outputs only dynamics information that is directly compensated by the fusion filter. This implies that depending on the solution type and the sensor availability, dynamics along some axes of the [vehicle-frame](#page-129-0) might not be available.

#### <span id="page-132-0"></span>**28.6.6 Raw Sensor Data Output**

(This feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01\)](#page-15-2).

Some u-blox module products contain inertial sensors (IMU) that are directly connected to the GNSS and cannot be directly accessed from outside the module. The [UBX-ESF-RAW](#page-295-1) message can be used to access raw measurements of these sensors. A variable number of data fields may be used in a single message and these can contain different types of measurements. The type of each measurement is specified in the dataType field. The possible data types are x, y and z-axis measurements on gyroscope or accelerometer and gyroscope temperature measurements as described in the [ESF Measurement Data](#page-149-0) section. One [UBX-ESF-RAW](#page-295-1) message can contain multiple samples from the same sensor. The user can separate and order these using the time tags attached to each of the measurements.





The measurements are made at a fixed rate. The sampling rate or other sensor configuration options can not be changed.

To turn on this feature the [UBX-ESF-RAW](#page-295-1) message must be enabled using [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1). If nonzero rate is selected the message will be output but the selected rate does not otherwise have an influence at the rate of the messages.

Turning on this feature does not disable sensor fusion in the receiver. To use an external fusion algorithm consider disabling the automotive dead reckoning mode using [UBX-](#page-233-1)[CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1).

## <span id="page-133-0"></span>**28.6.7 Receiver Startup and Shutdown**

Continuous dead reckoning is possible over receiver restarts if the following conditions are true:

- Non-volatile storage is available, or the [save-on-shutdown feature \(SOS\)](#page-25-2) is used
- The vehicle is not moved while the receiver is off

During periods of external sensor data unavailability the receiver switches to GNSS-only navigation if the last sensor information indicated the vehicle was moving.

## <span id="page-133-1"></span>**29 Untethered Dead Reckoning (UDR)**

This feature is only available with the [UDR](#page-133-1) products.

## <span id="page-133-2"></span>**29.1 Introduction**

u-blox solution for Untethered Dead Reckoning (UDR) allows improved navigation performance in places with GNSS-denied conditions as well as during short GNSS outages. UDR is based on Sensor Fusion Dead Reckoning (SFDR) technology, which integrates an Inertial Navigation System (INS) with GNSS measurements. The INS integrates angular rates and specific forces sensed by an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The INS computes position, velocity and attitude changes and can, once initialized, provide accurate navigation information. However, an inertialonly navigation solution would degrade quickly with time due to the errors corrupting the IMU observations. The integration of the INS with GNSS measurements bounds these time-growing errors by calibrating the INS. The resulting integrated INS/GNSS filter, called fusion filter below, has the following advantages compared to standalone GNSS positioning:

- Improved navigation performance in GNSS-denied conditions: errors caused by multipath or weak signal conditions are mitigated though the aid brought by the IMU.
- Navigation solution during short GNSS-outages: the INS bridges short GNSS gaps which might be caused by tunnels or parking garages.

UDR solution uses the messages of the [External Sensor Fusion \(ESF\)](#page-291-0) class.

## <span id="page-133-3"></span>**29.2 Installation Configuration**

(The features in this section are not supported in [protocol versions less than 19](#page-15-2)).

## <span id="page-133-4"></span>**29.2.1 IMU-mount Alignment**

(This feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01\)](#page-15-2).

The default assumption is that the IMU-frame and the installation-frame have the same orientation (i.e. all axes are parallel). If this assumption is not valid, the positioning solution can be degraded if the IMU-mount misalignment angles are small (typically few degrees) or can even fail



in case of large (tens of degrees) IMU-mount misalignments. Therefore, it is important to correctly configure the IMU-mount misalignment settings by using the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message.

This section describes how IMU-mount misalignment angles, i.e. the angles which rotate the installation-frame to the IMU-frame, can be configured using the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section below).

If the IMU-mount misalignment angles are unknown, they can be estimated during a dedicated initialization drive through an automatic alignment procedure. This is described in the [Automatic](#page-137-2) [IMU-Mount Alignment](#page-137-2) section below.

In u-blox module products containing an internal IMU (e.g. NEO-M8U modules), the IMUmount misalignment angles are estimated automatically by default (see [Automatic](#page-137-2) [IMU-Mount Alignment](#page-137-2) section below for further details).

## <span id="page-134-1"></span>**29.2.1.1 Definitions**

The IMU-mount misalignment angles are defined as follows:

- The transformation from the installation-frame to the IMU-frame is described by three Euler angles about the installation-frame axes denoted as IMU-mount roll, IMU-mount pitch and IMUmount yaw angles. All three angles are referred as the IMU-mount misalignment angles.
- There is a single IMU-mount misalignment configuration that applies to both gyroscopes and accelerometers, so these sensors must be aligned with each other if both types are present.

## <span id="page-134-0"></span>**29.2.1.2 User-defined IMU-mount Alignment**

The user can configure manually some IMU-mount roll, pitch and yaw angles using the [UBX-CFG-](#page-213-1)[ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message. The values that should be set in the configuration message are the Euler angles required to rotate the installation-frame to the IMU-frame. The IMU-mount yaw rotation should be performed first, then the IMU-mount pitch and finally the IMU-mount roll. At each stage, the rotation is around the appropriate axis of the transformed installation-frame, meaning that the order of the rotation sequence is important (see figure below).





If there is only a single IMU-mount misalignment angle then it may be measured as shown in the three examples below.





In order to prevent significant degradation of the positioning solution the IMU-mount misalignment angles should be configured with an accuracy of at least 5 degrees.

The list below describes in details how the fields in the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) message must be interpreted with respect to example illustrated in the figure above:

- **User-defined IMU-mount yaw angle**: The IMU-mount yaw angle (yaw) corresponds to the rotation around the installation-frame z-axis (vertical) required for aligning the installationframe to the IMU-frame (yaw = 344.0 deg if the IMU-mount misalignment is composed of a single rotation around the installation-frame z-axis, i.e. with no IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount pitch rotation).
- **User-defined IMU-mount pitch angle**: The IMU-mount pitch angle (pitch) corresponds to the rotation around the installation-frame y-axis required for aligning the installation-frame to the IMU-frame (pitch = 26.5 deg if the IMU-mount alignment is composed of a single rotation around the installation-frame y-axis, i.e. with no IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount yaw rotation).
- **User-defined IMU-mount roll angle**: The IMU-mount roll angle (roll) corresponds to the rotation around the installation-frame x-axis required for aligning the installation-frame to the IMU-frame (roll = -23.5 deg if the IMU-mount misalignment is composed of a single rotation around installation-frame x-axis, i.e. with no IMU-mount pitch and IMU-mount yaw rotation).



If automatic alignment is turned-on (see [Automatic IMU-mount Alignment](#page-137-2) section), the angles obtained by polling [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) are still the user-defined angles which do not correspond to the result of the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine as output in [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) (see [IMU-mount Misalignment Angles Output](#page-145-1) section for more details).

## <span id="page-137-2"></span>**29.2.1.3 Automatic IMU-mount Alignment**

The automatic IMU-mount alignment engine estimates automatically the IMU-mount roll, pitch and yaw angles. It requires an initialization phase during which no INS/GNSS fusion can be achieved (see [Filter Modes](#page-141-0) section for further details). The progress of the automatic alignment initialization can be monitored with the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message, and/or with the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message providing more details. When the vehicle is subject to sufficient dynamics (i.e. left and right turns during a normal drive), the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine will estimate the IMU-mount misalignment angles which have the same meaning as defined in the [Definitions](#page-134-1) section, regardless whether the user did or not enter manually some IMU-mount misalignment angles (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section). Once the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine has sufficient confidence in the estimated initial IMU-mount misalignment angles, the IMU-mount misalignment angles initialization phase is completed. The raw accelerometer and gyroscope data (i.e. the IMU observations) are then compensated for IMU-mount misalignment and sensor fusion can be done. The resulting IMU-mount misalignment angles are output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message.

For automatic IMU-mount alignemnt a 3-axis gyroscope and 3-axis accelerometer is required (only valid in [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2)).

## **29.2.1.3.1 Enabling/Disabling Automatic IMU-mount Alignment**

The user can activate/deactivate the automatic IMU-mount alignment by setting the doAutoMntAlg bit in the [UBX-CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) configuration message.

If automatic IMU-mount alignment is deactivated while aligning, the estimated misalignment angles that were available at deactivation time are used (only if they were initialized, see next section). If automatic IMU-mount alignment is re-activated, alignment is pursued by starting from the state where deactivation happened (only valid in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)).

## **29.2.1.4 Limitation with Single-Axis Gyroscope**

Gyroscope-mount misalignment is only supported when a three-axis gyroscope is available. In case of a single-axis gyroscope, the sensor should be physically aligned along the installationframe z-axis. This is needed to avoid a scale factor error which will affect the accuracy of the output due to the two missing gyroscopes.

## <span id="page-137-0"></span>**29.3 Sensor Configuration**

This section describes the external sensor configuration parameters.

## <span id="page-137-1"></span>**29.3.1 Accelerometer Configuration**

The accelerometer sensor senses specific forces, expressed in meters per seconds squared, along its input axis. In the full configuration, an IMU contains a three-axis accelerometer whose sensitive axes are assumed to be mutually orthogonal in a Cartesian frame.

## <span id="page-138-0"></span>**29.3.2 Gyroscope Configuration**

The gyroscope sensor senses angular rates, expressed in radians per seconds or degrees per second, along its input axis. In the full configuration, an IMU contains a three-axis gyroscope whose sensitive axes are assumed to be mutually orthogonal in a Cartesian frame.

The gyroscope sensor can be configured in the following message:

#### **Configuration Messages for UDR Products**

| Product Type | Message      |
|--------------|--------------|
| Chipset      | UBX-CFG-ESFG |

### **29.3.2.2 Temperature Compensation**

Gyroscope sensors generally exhibit a temperature-dependent bias that varies from unit to unit. To help compensate for this variation the receiver builds up a table of gyroscope bias versus temperature measurements which are often available from the gyroscope sensor itself. This is particularly valuable to dead-reckoning-only navigation after the vehicle has been left for some time in parking garage.

The gyroscope temperature compensation engine has the following settings:

- **Gyroscope RMS threshold above which temperature table is not updated**: The gyroscope temperature-dependent bias is only updated if the measured gyroscope angular rate RMS is below the given threshold. This avoids artificially high estimates of the gyroscope temperaturedependent bias from transient events such as vehicle engine starts or nearby heavy construction. This threshold can be configured in the gyroRmsThdl field and is shared with the sensor accuracy estimation engine (see above);
- **Temperature-dependent bias table saving rate**: Gyroscope temperature compensation data are saved to non-volatile storage at intervals that can be configured by the tcTableSaveRate field.

The gyroscope temperature-dependent bias table is revised under the following conditions:

- The vehicle is stationary (without wheel-tick measurements or at zero speed);
- The RMS of the measured gyroscope angular rates and accelerometer specific forces is below a given threshold (see above);
- Turntable mode is not engaged (only for ADR products, see [Ferry and Turntable Modes](#page-14-0) section);
- Gyroscope temperature compensation is effective if the gyroscope(s) exhibits repeatable characteristics with temperature and is not unduly affected by external factors (such as supply voltage or mechanical stress).



## <span id="page-139-0"></span>**29.3.3 Sensor Time Tagging**

In order to achieve optimal performance with the fusion solution it is essential to determine the epoch in the receiver time frame when the external sensor measurements were generated. This may be done in one of the following ways:

- First Byte Reception: reception time of first byte of [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message
- Time Mark on External Input: reception time of time mark signal sent to external input

The latency of the sensor data is the time between when the sensor measurement was taken and the detection at the receiver of either the first byte of the [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message or the preprocessor's time mark, depending on the timing approach chosen. Increased latency reduces the navigation performance.

In ADR, the latency can be set by using the latency, wtLatency, gyroLatency and accelLatency parameters in the appropriate configuration message, as discussed in the [Automotive Dead](#page-112-1) [Reckoning \(ADR\)](#page-112-1) chapter.

In UDR, the latency can be set by using the latency parameter in the appropriate sensor configuration message, as discussed in the [Untethered Dead Reckoning \(UDR\)](#page-133-1) chapter.

## **29.3.3.1 First Byte Reception**

The easiest way to determine the sensor measurement generation time is to have the GNSS receiver assume the time of reception of the first byte of the [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message (minus a constant configured latency) to be the time of sensor measurement. This approach is the simplest to implement, but [Time Mark on External Input](#page-139-1) can yield better latency control and compensation.



## <span id="page-139-1"></span>**29.3.3.2 Time Mark on External Input**

In this case, the preprocessor unit generating the measurements sends a signal to the EXTINT input of the GNSS receiver, marking the moment of measurement generation. The subsequent [UBX-ESF-MEAS](#page-294-1) message is then flagged accordingly, and the measurements in the message will be assumed to have been generated at the time of external signal reception (minus a constant configured latency). This approach is the preferred solution, but it can be difficult to realize an exact analog time signal for the preprocessor unit.





## <span id="page-140-4"></span>**29.3.3.3 Sensor Time Tagging Configuration**

The receiver requires external sensor packets time tagged in seconds.

The external sensor time tagging for WT can be configured in the [UBX-CFG-ESFWT](#page-215-2) (not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01](#page-15-2)).

The following sensor time tagging settings need to be specified:

- **Sensor time tag scale factor to seconds:** (timeTagFactor): This parameters converts the sensor time tags from their original time unit into the required seconds. For example if the IMU raw packets are time-tagged in milliseconds, the scale factor for converting one millisecond into one seconds is 0.001.
- **Sensor time tag maximum value:** (timeTagMax): External sensor time tags are encoded in different data types (signed/unsigned, varying number of bytes) which might vary across sensor types. For example if the IMU raw packet's time-tag field is encoded into an unsigned long integer (4 bytes), the maximum possible time-tag value is 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFFin hexadecimal).

## <span id="page-140-0"></span>**29.4 UDR System Configuration**

(These features are not supported in [protocol versions less than 19\)](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-140-1"></span>**29.4.1 Enabling/Disabling Fusion Filter**

The UDR fusion filter can be turned off by means of the useAdr bit in the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) configuration message. If fusion is turned off, the receiver outputs a GNSS-only solution.

## <span id="page-140-2"></span>**29.4.2 Recommended Configuration**

For an optimum navigation performance, the recommended general configuration is the following:

- **Navigation Rate**: the standard navigation solution update rate of 1 Hz (see [UBX-CFG-RATE](#page-268-1) message) is recommended.
- Reconsider the enabled messages and features (e.g logging) at higher navigation rates to meet CPU load, memory and interface bandwidth constraints (Valid in [protocol](#page-15-2) [versions 19.2](#page-15-2)).

## <span id="page-141-0"></span>**29.5.1 Fusion Filter Modes**

The fusion filter operates in different modes which are output in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message.

The table below summarizes the different fusion filter modes with the associated tasks the receiver is doing.

More details about each fusion mode are given in the following sections.

## <span id="page-141-1"></span>**29.5.1.1 Initialization Mode**

The purpose of the initialization phase is to estimate all unknown parameters which are required for achieving fusion. The initialization phase is triggered after a receiver cold start or a filter reset in case of fusion failure. The receiver is in initialization mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-](#page-296-1)[ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is 0:INITIALIZING. In this case the required sensor calibration status (cal ibStatus) is flagged as 0: NOT CALIBRATED and the navigation solution output during initialization is based on GNSS solely.

The initialization phase comprises the following internal steps whose status is published in the initStatus field of the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message:

- **IMU initialization:** Unknown crucial IMU parameters such as sensor sampling frequency are estimated during initialization. As long as all required IMU parameters are not initialized, the status of the IMU initialization (imuInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-](#page-296-1)[STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Moreover, the required sensor calibration statuses (calibStatus) are flagged as 0:NOT CALIBRATED in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Note that if the user configured all required sensor settings, this step is skipped and IMU initialization is flagged as 2: INITIALIZED (not supported in [protocol versions less than 19](#page-15-2)).
- **IMU-mount alignment initialization:** If automatic IMU-mount alignment is enabled (see the [Automatic IMU-mount Alignment Configuration](#page-137-2) section), initial IMU-mount roll, IMU-mount pitch and IMU-mount yaw angles need to be estimated. For that, good GNSS signal reception as



well as sufficient vehicle dynamics (i.e. a series of left and right turns during a normal drive) need to be at hand. As long as the IMU-mount alignment is not initialized, the status of the IMUmount alignment (mntAlgStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the IMU-mount alignment status is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED. If no IMU-mount alignment is required, the IMU-mount alignment is flagged as 0:OFF. A detailed description of the automatic IMU-mount alignment operation can be found in the [Automatic](#page-145-0) [IMU-mount Alignment Operation](#page-145-0) section (not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01](#page-15-2)).

â¢ **INS initialization:** Before entering fusion mode, the initial vehicle position, velocity and especially attitude (vehicle roll, pitch heading angles) needs to be known with sufficient accuracy. This is achieved during INS initialization phase (which comprises an INS coarse alignment step) using GNSS. As long as the fusion filter isn't initialized, the status of the INS initialization (insInitSt atus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the INS initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED (not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01](#page-15-2)).

This section is valid only for [protocol versions less than 19.2](#page-15-2)

â¢ **Wheel-tick sensor initialization (ADR products only):** Before entering fusion mode, some parameters like initial wheel-tick factors need to be estimated with sufficient accuracy. This is achieved during wheel-tick sensor initialization phase using GNSS. As long as the wheel-tick parameters are not initialized, the status of the wheel-tick initialization (wtInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the wheel-tick sensor initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED and the parameters are stored in non-volatile storage. If no wheel-tick data are required (in UDR products), the wheel-tick initialization is flagged as 0:OFF (only valid in [protocol versions less than 19.2](#page-15-2)).

This section is valid only for [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2)

- **Wheel-tick sensor initialization (ADR products only):** Solution enters fusion mode (fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is on 1:FUSION), even when wheel-tick is not yet initialized, following a [UDR](#page-133-1) mode approach. WT sensor parameters, like initial wheel-tick factors, are estimated in parallel and are used once estimated with sufficient accuracy. As long as the wheel-tick parameters are not initialized, the status of the wheel-tick initialization (wtIni tStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message. Once initialized, the wheel-tick sensor initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED, WT data are used by the filter and the parameters are stored in non-volatile storage. If no wheel-tick data are required (in UDR products), the wheel-tick initialization is flagged as 0:OFF (only valid in [protocol versions 19.2+](#page-15-2)).
- Beside the wheel-tick factors, other parameters like direction pin polarity are initialized if requested.
- **Sensor error (e.g. missing data) detected:** Sensor timeout of more than 500ms will trigger an INS re-initialization (not supported in [protocol versions less than 19.2\)](#page-15-2).

Note that initialization phase requires good GNSS signal conditions as well as periods during which vehicle is stationary and moving (including turns). Once all required initialization steps are achieved, fusion mode is triggered and the calibration phase begins.

#### <span id="page-142-0"></span>**29.5.1.2 Fusion Mode**

Once initialization phase is achieved, the receiver enters navigation mode. The receiver is in fusion mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is set on 1:FUSION. The fusion filter then starts to compute combined GNSS/dead-reckoning fixes (fused solutions) and to calibrate the sensors required for computing the fused navigation solution (used bit set). This is



the case when the sensor calibration status (calibStatus) is flagged as 1:CALIBRATING. As soon as the calibration reaches a status where optimal fusion performance can be expected, the sensor calibration status is flagged as 2/3:CALIBRATED.

## <span id="page-143-1"></span>**29.5.1.3 Suspended Fusion Mode**

Sensor fusion can be temporarily suspended in cases where no fused solution should/can be computed. The receiver is in the temporarily disabled fusion mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is set on 2:SUSPENDED. In this case, the receiver computes a GNSSonly solution.

Fusion is suspended if:

- One or several sensors deliver erroneous data or no data at all, the fusion is suspended during the sensor failure period. The receiver automatically recovers once the affected sensor(s) is/are back to normal operation (only supported in [protocol versions less than 19.2\)](#page-15-2).
- The vehicle is detected to be on a ferry where wheel-ticks do not detect any displacement (in ADR products only).

## <span id="page-143-2"></span>**29.5.1.4 Disabled Fusion Mode**

Sensor fusion can be permanently switched off in cases where recurrent fusion failures happen or user turned off manually fusion. The receiver is in the permanently disabled fusion mode if the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message is set on 3:DISABLED. In such a case, the receiver computes a GNSS-only solution.

Fusion is permanently disabled in the following cases:

- If the fusion filter was manually turned off by the user (useAdr bit in the [UBX-CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1) message is not set).
- If significantly wrong installation or filter parameters causing filter divergence are sent to the receiver.
- If the fusion filter encountered too many errors.

An IMU-mount alignment error is output in the error field in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message.

## <span id="page-143-0"></span>**29.5.2 Accelerated Initialization and Calibration Procedure**

This section describes how to perform fast initialization and calibration of the UDR receiver for the purpose of evaluation.

The duration of the initialization phase mostly depends on the quality of the GNSS signals and the dynamics encountered by the vehicle. Therefore the car should be driven to an open and flat area like an empty open-sky parking area for example. The initialization and calibration drive should contain phases where the car is stopped during a few minutes (with engine turned-on), phases where the car is doing normal left and right turns and phases where speed is above 30 km/h under good GNSS reception conditions.

The initialization time required for reaching fused navigation mode can be shortened by following the procedure in the order described in the table below.

#### **Accelerated Initialization Procedure**

Once initialization is completed, the fusionMode field in the [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message switches to 1:FUSION, combined GNSS/Dead-reckoning fixes (fused solutions) are output and the sensors used in the navigation filter start to get calibrated. Calibration is a continuous process running in the background and improving the navigation solution quality.

The calibration time required for reaching optimal UDR navigation performance can be shortened by following the procedure described in the table below.

## **Accelerated Calibration Procedure**

Note that the calibration status (calibStatus in [UBX-ESF-STATUS](#page-296-1) message) of some used sensors might fall back to 1:CALIBRATING if the receiver is operated in challenging conditions. In such a case, fused navigation solution uncertainty increases until optimal conditions are observed again for re-calibrating the sensors.

The fused navigation performance quality might also depend on how well the gyroscope temperature compensation table is populated. The table gradually fills in while the vehicle is stationary and by observing gyroscope biases at different temperatures. Therefore the quality of the gyroscope temperature compensation depends on how many temperature bins could be observed while the vehicle was stationary and on the duration of observation for each bin.

## <span id="page-145-0"></span>**29.5.3 Automatic IMU-mount Alignment**

(This feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01\)](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-145-1"></span>**29.5.3.1 Alignment Solution Output**

The IMU-mount misalignment angles are output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message. They have the following meaning:

- **IMU-mount yaw angle**: During IMU-mount yaw angle initialization (status field is equal to 2), the published angle (yaw) corresponds to the current estimated value but is not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations. After initialization (status field is equal or higher than 3), the published angle corresponds to the estimated value and is applied for rotating the IMU observations. If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angle corresponds to the IMU-mount yaw angle configured by the user (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and is applied for rotating the IMU observations.
- **IMU-mount pitch angle**: During IMU-mount pitch angle initialization (status field is equal to 1), the published angle (pitch) corresponds to the current estimated value but is not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations. After initialization (status field is equal or higher than 3), the published angle corresponds to the estimated value and is applied for rotating the IMU observations. If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angle corresponds to the IMU-mount pitch angle configured by the user (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and is applied for rotating the IMU observations.
- **IMU-mount roll angle**: During IMU-mount roll angle initialization (status field is equal to 1), the published angle (roll) corresponds to the current estimated value but is not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations. After initialization (status field is equal or higher than 3), the published angle corresponds to the estimated value and is applied for rotating the IMU



observations. If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angle corresponds to the IMU-mount roll angle configured by the user (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and is applied for rotating the IMU observations.

If user-defined IMU-mount misalignment angles were configured by the user using [UBX-](#page-213-1)[CFG-ESFALG](#page-213-1) (see [User-defined Configuration](#page-134-0) section) and automatic IMU-mount alignment is active, the angles output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message still correspond to the definition given above: they represent the full rotation required for transforming IMU data from installation-frame to IMU-frame. This means that the output misalignment angles are computed from the composed rotation of the user-defined rotation and the internally-estimated rotation.

## **29.5.3.2 Alignment Progress**

The progress of the automatic IMU-mount alignment can be monitored by checking the status field in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message (see the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message description for the meaning of the values output in the status field).

- **IMU-mount roll/pitch angle initialization ongoing**: The alignment engine is initializing the IMUmount roll and pitch angles (status is 1). Both angles can only be initialized if vehicle encounters left and right turns (as occurring during a normal drive).
- **IMU-mount yaw angle initialization ongoing**: The alignment engine is initializing the IMU-mount yaw angle (status is 2). IMU-mount yaw angle can only be initialized once IMU-mount roll and pitch angles are initialized and if vehicle encounters left and right turns (as occurring during a normal drive).
- **IMU-mount misalignment angles are initialized** (only supported in [protocol versions 15.01 to 17\)](#page-15-2): The alignment engine has sufficient confidence in all IMU-mount misalignment angles and validates their use for compensating the accelerometer and gyroscope data, i.e. fused navigation solutions can be computed (status is 3).
- **IMU-mount alignment coarse calibration ongoing** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2): Once initialized (status is 3), the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine has sufficient confidence in all IMU-mount misalignment angles and validates their use for compensating the accelerometer and gyroscope data (fused navigation solutions can be computed). The engine keeps filtering the IMU-mount misalignment angles every time the observed vehicle dynamics allows for it.
- **IMU-mount alignment fine calibration ongoing** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)): Once the IMU-mount misalignment angles are estimated with a good accuracy, the automatic IMUmount alignment engine becomes more conservative in updating the IMU-mount misalignment angles (status is 4).

## **29.5.3.3 Alignment Errors**

The following errors might be output in the error bitfield of the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message:

- **IMU-mount misalignment angle error** (only supported in [protocol versions 15.01 to 17\)](#page-15-2): If the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount misalignment angles (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the error bit 0 in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message is set.
- **IMU-mount roll/pitch angle error** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)): If the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount roll and/or IMU-mount pitch misalignment angles (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of



the device), the error bit 0 in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message is set.

- **IMU-mount yaw angle error** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2): If the automatic IMUmount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount yaw misalignment angle (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the error bit 1 in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) message is set.
- **Euler Angle singularity ('gimbal-lock') error** (only supported in [protocol versions 19+](#page-15-2)): The Euler angle singularity error bit 2 is set when the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine detects an installation where the IMU-frame is misaligned in such a way that a degree of freedom is lost when two IMU-mount misalignment (Euler) angles begin to describe the same rotations (or axes). This happens for example with an IMU-mount misalignment of +/- 90 degrees around the IMU-mount pitch axis, where IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount yaw cannot be distinguished from each other. In such a case, these IMU-mount misalignment angles start to heavily fluctuate with time due to the mathematical singularity occurring at these points, meaning that the IMUmount misalignment angles output in the [UBX-ESF-ALG](#page-291-0) are not stable in time. Note however that each individual set of IMU-mount misalignment angles output in such a case still describes the correct rotation. Moreover, the internal rotation applied for aligning the IMU readings doesn't suffer from this singularity issue and optimal fusion can still be achieved.

## <span id="page-147-0"></span>**29.5.4 Navigation Output**

(Only supported in [protocol versions 19+\)](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-147-2"></span>**29.5.4.1 Local-level North-East-Down (NED) Frame**

The local-level frame is a geodetic frame with following features:

- The origin (O) is a point on the Earth surface;
- The x-axis points to North;
- the y-axis points to East;
- the z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.

The frame is referred to as North-East-Down (NED) since its axes are aligned with the North, East and Down directions.

## <span id="page-147-1"></span>**29.5.4.2 Body-Frame**

The body-frame is a right-handed 3D Cartesian frame rigidly connected with the vehicle and is used to determine the attitude of the vehicle with respect to the local-level frame. It has the following features:

- The origin (O) is the origin of the IMU instrumental frame;
- The x-axis points towards the front of the vehicle;
- the y-axis points towards the right of the vehicle;
- the z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.

## **29.5.4.3 Vehicle Position and Velocity Output**

The position and velocity information is output in several messages like [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) for example. The position computed by the UDR navigation filter is referenced to the origin (O) of the [body-frame](#page-147-1).



## <span id="page-148-0"></span>**29.5.4.4 Vehicle Attitude Output**

The transformation between the [body-frame](#page-147-1) and the [local-level frame](#page-147-2) is described by three attitude angles about the local-level axes denoted as vehicle roll, vehicle pitch and vehicle heading. All three angles are referred as vehicle attitude and are illustrated in the figure below:



The order of the sequence of rotations around the navigation axes defining the vehicle attitude matrix in terms of vehicle attitude angles is illustrated below:



$$
\mathbf{C}_X = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\phi) & \sin(\phi) \\ 0 & -\sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi) \end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{C}_Y = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & 0 & -\sin(\theta) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{C}_Z = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\psi) & \sin(\psi) & 0 \\ -\sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
C_b^n = C_Z^T \cdot C_Y^T \cdot C_X^T
$$
  
= 
$$
\begin{bmatrix} \cos (\theta) \cos (\psi) & \sin (\phi) \sin (\theta) \cos (\psi) - \cos (\phi) \sin (\psi) & \cos (\phi) \sin (\theta) \cos (\psi) + \sin (\phi) \sin (\psi) \\ \cos (\theta) \sin (\psi) & \sin (\phi) \sin (\theta) \sin (\psi) + \cos (\phi) \cos (\psi) & \cos (\phi) \sin (\theta) \sin (\psi) - \sin (\phi) \cos (\psi) \\ - \sin (\theta) & \sin (\phi) \cos (\theta) & \cos (\theta) \end{bmatrix}
$$

The vehicle attitude is output in the [UBX-NAV-ATT](#page-372-1) message. The message provides all three angles together with their accuracy estimates. Note that since no backwards motion information is measured, no heading of motion information is output in the [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1) message (heading of vehicle is provided in a separate field within the same message).

## **29.5.4.5 Vehicle Dynamics Output**

The [UBX-ESF-INS](#page-292-1) message outputs information about vehicle dynamics provided by the INS: compensated vehicle angular rates and compensated vehicle accelerations. The acceleration data is free of any gravitational acceleration. It's accuracy is directly dependent on the filter attitude estimation accuracy.

Compensated vehicle dynamics information is output with respect to the [body-frame.](#page-147-1)

## <span id="page-150-0"></span>**29.5.6 Raw Sensor Data Output**

(This feature is not supported in [protocol versions less than 15.01\)](#page-15-2).

Some u-blox module products contain inertial sensors (IMU) that are directly connected to the GNSS and cannot be directly accessed from outside the module. The [UBX-ESF-RAW](#page-295-1) message can be used to access raw measurements of these sensors. A variable number of data fields may be used in a single message and these can contain different types of measurements. The type of each measurement is specified in the dataType field. The possible data types are x, y and z-axis measurements on gyroscope or accelerometer and gyroscope temperature measurements as described in the [ESF Measurement Data](#page-149-0) section. One [UBX-ESF-RAW](#page-295-1) message can contain multiple samples from the same sensor. The user can separate and order these using the time tags attached to each of the measurements.

The measurements are made at a fixed rate. The sampling rate or other sensor configuration options can not be changed.

To turn on this feature the [UBX-ESF-RAW](#page-295-1) message must be enabled using [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1). If nonzero rate is selected the message will be output but the selected rate does not otherwise have an



### influence at the rate of the messages.

Turning on this feature does not disable sensor fusion in the receiver. To use an external fusion algorithm consider disabling the automotive dead reckoning mode using [UBX-](#page-233-1)[CFG-NAVX5](#page-233-1).

#### <span id="page-151-0"></span>**29.5.7 Receiver Startup and Shutdown**

Continuous dead reckoning is possible over receiver restarts if the following conditions are true:

- Non-volatile storage is available, or the [save-on-shutdown feature \(SOS\)](#page-25-2) is used
- The vehicle is not moved while the receiver is off

During periods of external sensor data unavailability the receiver switches to GNSS-only navigation if the last sensor information indicated the vehicle was moving.

This feature is only available with the [ADR](#page-112-1) products.

This feature is only available with the [UDR](#page-133-1) products.

## <span id="page-151-2"></span>**30.1 Introduction**

u-blox DR solutions allow a low latency position and velocity to be output at up to 30 Hz. The maximum GNSS rate is 2 Hz. Sensors measurements are used to propagate the solution at the higher rate between GNSS epochs.

The high navigation rate solution is output using the [UBX-HNR-PVT](#page-302-1) message for firmwares using [protocol version 19+](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-151-3"></span>**30.2 Configuration**

The high navigation rate output can be configured using the [UBX-CFG-HNR](#page-224-2) message.

If a high navigation rate has been configured with [UBX-CFG-HNR](#page-224-2) then the number of enabled output messages must be adjusted to keep within the maximum throughput of the interface used.

For further information on the NMEA Standard, refer to NMEA 0183 Standard For Interfacing Marine Electronic Devices, Version 4.10, June, 2012. See <http://www.nmea.org/>for ordering instructions.

The NMEA standard allows for proprietary, manufacturer-specific messages to be added. These shall be marked with a manufacturer mnemonic. The mnemonic assigned to u-blox is UBX and is used for all non-standard messages. These proprietary NMEA messages therefore have the address field set to PUBX. The first data field in a PUBX message identifies the message number with two digits.

## <span id="page-152-4"></span>**31.1.2 Talker ID**

One of the ways the NMEA standard differentiates between GNSS is by using a two-letter message identifier, the 'Talker ID'. The specific Talker ID used by a u-blox receiver will depend on the device model and system configuration. The table below shows the Talker ID that will be used for various GNSS configurations.



### **NMEA Talker IDs**

| Configured GNSS         | Talker ID |
|-------------------------|-----------|
| GPS, SBAS, QZSS         | GP        |
| GLONASS                 | GL        |
| Galileo                 | GA        |
| BeiDou                  | GB*       |
| Any combination of GNSS | GN        |

\*This is a u-blox extension to the NMEA 4.10 standard. Only NMEA 4.11 defines the GB talker ID. See also Extended Configuration in [Protocol Configuration](#page-153-0).

## <span id="page-153-0"></span>**31.1.3 Protocol configuration**

The NMEA protocol on u-blox receivers can be configured to the need of customer applications using [UBX-CFG-NMEA](#page-240-1). For backwards compatibility various versions of this message are supported, however, any new users should use the version that is not marked as deprecated.

There are four NMEA standards supported. The default NMEA version is 4.10. Alternatively versions 4.00, 2.3, and 2.1 can be enabled (for details on how this affects the output refer to section [Position Fix Flags in NMEA Mode\)](#page-155-1).

- Customers using BeiDou and/or Galileo are recommended to select NMEA version 4.10, as earlier versions have no support for these two GNSS.
- Customers using High Precision GNSS (HPG) products are recommended to select NMEA version 4.10, as earlier versions do no support the Float RTK (F) and Real Time Kinematic (R) mode indicator flags in all messages.

NMEA defines satellite numbering systems for some, but not all GNSS (this is partly dependent on the NMEA version). Satellite numbers for unsupported GNSS can be configured using [UBX-](#page-240-1)[CFG-NMEA](#page-240-1). Unknown satellite numbers are always reported as a null NMEA field (i.e. an empty string).

The NMEA specification indicates that the GGA message is GPS-specific. However, u-blox receivers support the output of a GGA message for each of the Talker IDs.

| Valid position     | Enable positions from invalid fixes to be reported (with the "V" status flag to   |

| GPS-only filtering | Restrict output to GPS satellites only.                                           |
| Track filtering    | Permit course over ground (COG) to be reported even when it would otherwise       |
|                    | be frozen.                                                                        |

| Compatibility  | Some older NMEA applications expect the NMEA output to be formatted in a          |
| Mode           | specific way, for example, they will only work if the latitude and longitude have |
|                | exactly four digits behind the decimal point. u-blox receivers offer a            |
|                | compatibility mode to support these legacy applications.                          |
| Consideration  | u-blox receivers use a sophisticated signal quality detection scheme, in order    |
| Mode           | to produce the best possible position output. This algorithm considers all SV     |
|                | measurements, and may eventually decide to only use a subset thereof, if it       |
|                | improves the overall position accuracy. If Consideration Mode is enabled, all     |
|                | satellites, which were considered for navigation, are communicated as being       |
|                | used for the position determination. If Consideration Mode is disabled, only      |
|                | those satellites which after the consideration step remained in the position      |
|                | output are marked as being used.                                                  |
| Limit82 Mode   | Enabling this mode will limit the NMEA sentence length to a maximum of 82         |
|                | characters.                                                                       |
| High Precision | Enabling this mode increases precision of the position output. Latitude and       |
| Mode           | longitude then have seven digits after the decimal point, and altitude has        |
|                | three digits after the decimal point. Note: The High Precision Mode cannot be     |

| Main Talker ID | By default the main Talker ID (i.e. the Talker ID used for all messages other     |

| GSV Talker ID  | By default the Talker ID for GSV messages is GNSS-specific (as defined by         |
|                | NMEA). This field enables the GSV Talker ID to be overridden.                     |
| BDS Talker ID  | By default the Talker ID for BeiDou is 'GB'. This field enables the BeiDou Talker |

## <span id="page-154-0"></span>**31.1.4 Satellite numbering**

The NMEA protocol (V4.10) identifies GNSS satellites with a one digit system ID and a two digit satellite number. u-blox receivers support this method in their NMEA output when "strict" SV numbering is selected.



In most cases this is the default setting, but can be checked or set using [UBX-CFG-NMEA](#page-240-1).

In order to support QZSS within current receivers and prepare for support of other systems (e.g. Galileo) in future receivers, an "extended" SV numbering scheme can be enabled (using [UBX-CFG-](#page-240-1)[NMEA](#page-240-1)).

This uses the NMEA-defined numbers where possible, but adds other number ranges to support other GNSS. Note however that these non-standard extensions require 3 digit numbers, which may not be supported by some NMEA parsing software. For example QZSS satellites are reported using numbers in the range 193 to 197.

See [Satellite Numbering](#page-460-1) for a complete list of satellite numbers.

GLONASS satellites can be tracked before they have been identified. In NMEA output, such unknown satellite numbers are always reported as a null field (i.e. an empty string).

## <span id="page-155-0"></span>**31.1.5 Latitude and longitude format**

According to the NMEA Standard, Latitude and Longitude are output in the format of Degrees, Minutes and (Decimal) Fractions of Minutes. To convert to Degrees and Fractions of Degrees, or Degrees, Minutes, Seconds and Fractions of seconds, the 'Minutes' and 'Fractional Minutes' parts need to be converted. In other words: If the GPS Receiver reports a Latitude of 4717.112671 North and Longitude of 00833.914843 East, this is

Latitude 47 Degrees, 17.112671 Minutes

Longitude 8 Degrees, 33.914843 Minutes

(4) Possible values for posMode: N = No fix, E = Estimated/Dead reckoning fix, A = Autonomous GNSS fix, D = Differential GNSS fix, F = RTK float, R = RTK fixed

## **Flags in NMEA 2.1 and below**

The flags in NMEA 2.1 and below are the same as NMEA 2.3 and above but with the following differences:

- The posMode field is not output for GLL, RMC and VTG messages (each message has one field less).
- The GGA quality field is set to 1 (instead of 6) for both types of dead reckoning fix.

## <span id="page-156-0"></span>**31.1.7 Multi-GNSS considerations**

Many applications which process NMEA messages assume that only a single GNSS is active. However, when multiple GNSS are configured, the NMEA specification requires the output to change in the following ways:

| Change         | Description                                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Main Talker ID | The main Talker ID will be 'GN' (e.g. instead of 'GP' for a GPS receiver) |
| GSV Talker IDs | The GSV message reports the signal strength of the visible                |
|                | satellites. However, the Talker ID it uses is specific to the GNSS it is  |
|                | reporting information for, so for a multi-GNSS receiver it will not be    |
|                | the same as the main Talker ID (e.g. other messages will be using the     |
|                | 'GN' Talker ID but the GSV message will use GNSS-specific Talker          |
|                | IDs).                                                                     |

## **NMEA output for Multi-GNSS**



NMEA output for Multi-GNSS continued

| Change               | Description                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multiple GSA and GRS | Multiple GSA and GRS messages are output for each fix, one for                                                                        |
| Messages             | each GNSS. This may confuse applications which assume they are<br>output only once per position fix (as is the case for a single GNSS |
|                      | receiver).                                                                                                                            |

## <span id="page-157-0"></span>**31.1.8 Output of invalid/unknown data**

By default the receiver will not output invalid data. In such cases, it will output empty fields.

A valid position fix is reported as follows:

\$GPGLL,4717.11634,N,00833.91297,E,124923.00,A,A\*6E

An invalid position fix (but time valid) is reported as follows:

\$GPGLL,,,,,124924.00,V,N\*42

If Time is unknown (e.g. during a cold start):

\$GPGLL,,,,,,V,N\*64

Note:

- An exception from the above default are dead reckoning fixes, which are also output when invalid (user limits exceeded).
- Differing from the NMEA standard, u-blox reports valid dead reckoning fixes with user limits met (not exceeded) as valid (A) instead of invalid (V).
- Output of invalid data marked with the 'Invalid/Valid' Flags can be enabled using the UBX protocol message [UBX-CFG-NMEA](#page-240-1).

## <span id="page-157-1"></span>**31.1.9 Messages overview**

When configuring NMEA messages using the UBX protocol message [UBX-CFG-MSG](#page-229-1), the Class/Ids shown in the table shall be used.

These fields are<br>never output if 4 or fewer satellites are used for the navigation calculation<br>(because, in such cases, integrity cannot be determined by the receiver<br>autonomously).<br>â¢ The fields prob, bias and stdev are only output if at least one satellite failed in<br>the RAIM test. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| Comment     | The output of this message is dependent on the currently selected datum<br>(default: WGS84). The NMEA specification indicates that the GGA message is<br>GPS-specific. However, when the receiver is configured for multi-GNSS, the<br>GGA message contents will be generated from the multi-GNSS solution. For<br>multi-GNSS use, it is recommended that the NMEA-GNS message is used<br>instead. |

## <span id="page-182-0"></span>**32 UBX Protocol**

## <span id="page-182-1"></span>**32.1 UBX Protocol Key Features**

u-blox receivers support a u-blox proprietary protocol to communicate with a host. This protocol has the following key features:

- Compact uses 8-bit binary data.
- Checksum protected uses a low-overhead checksum algorithm
- Modular uses a 2-stage message identifier (Class and Message ID)

## <span id="page-182-2"></span>**32.2 UBX Frame Structure**

The structure of a basic UBX Frame is shown in the following diagram.





- Every **Frame** starts with a 2-byte Preamble consisting of two synchronization characters: 0xB5 0x62.
- A 1-byte Message **Class** field follows. A Class is a group of messages that are related to each other.
- A 1-byte Message **ID** field defines the message that is to follow.
- A 2-byte **Length** field follows. The length is defined as being that of the payload only. It does not include the Preamble, Message Class, Message ID, Length, or Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) fields. The number format of the length field is a Little-Endian unsigned 16-bit integer.
- The **Payload** field contains a variable number of bytes.
- The two 1-byte **CK\_A** and **CK\_B** fields hold a 16-bit checksum whose calculation is defined below. This concludes the Frame.

## <span id="page-183-0"></span>**32.3 UBX Payload Definition Rules**

## <span id="page-183-1"></span>**32.3.1 Structure Packing**

Values are placed in such an order that structure packing is not a problem. This means that 2 byte values shall start on offsets which are a multiple of 2; 4-byte values shall start at a multiple of 4; and so on.

## <span id="page-183-2"></span>**32.3.2 Reserved Elements**

Some messages contain reserved fields or bits to allow for future expansion. The contents of these elements should be ignored in output messages and must be set to zero in input messages. Where a message is output and subsequently returned to the receiver as an input message, reserved elements can either be explicitly set to zero or left with whatever value they were output with.



## <span id="page-184-0"></span>**32.3.3 Undefined Values**

The description of some fields provides specific meanings for specific values. For example, the field gnssId appears in many UBX messages and uses 0 to indicate GPS, 1 for SBAS and so on (see [Satellite Numbering](#page-460-1) for details); however it is usually stored in a byte with far more possible values than the handful currently defined. All such undefined values are reserved for future expansion and therefore should not be used.

## <span id="page-184-1"></span>**32.3.4 Message Naming**

Referring to messages is done by adding the class name and a dash in front of the message name. For example, the version information message is referred to as UBX-MON-VER. Referring to message fields or their values is done by adding a dot and the name, e.g. UBX-MON-VER. swVersion.

## <span id="page-184-2"></span>**32.3.5 Number Formats**

All multi-byte values are ordered in Little Endian format, unless otherwise indicated. All floating point values are transmitted in IEEE754 single or double precision.

The description of some integer values (e.g. U2, I4 or I8) indicates a fixed-point format (e.g. [UU.FF], [IIIII.FFF] or [IIIIIII.FFFFFFFF]). The fixed-point value can be retrieved from the integer value by first casting it to appropriate type (e.g. as a floatingpoint number) and then scaling it with the indicated scaling factor.

## <span id="page-185-0"></span>**32.4 UBX Checksum**

The checksum is calculated over the Message, starting and including the CLASS field up until, but excluding, the Checksum Field:



The checksum algorithm used is the 8-Bit Fletcher Algorithm, which is used in the TCP standard ( [RFC 1145](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1145.txt)). This algorithm works as follows:

- Buffer[N] contains the data over which the checksum is to be calculated.
- The two CK\_ values are 8-Bit unsigned integers only! If implementing with larger-sized integer values, make sure to mask both CK\_A and CK\_B with 0xFF after both operations in the loop.

```
 CK_A = 0, CK_B = 0
 For(I=0;I<N;I++)
 {
```



}

 CK\_A = CK\_A + Buffer[I] CK\_B = CK\_B + CK\_A

â¢ After the loop, the two U1 values contain the checksum, transmitted after the Message, which conclude the Frame.

## <span id="page-186-0"></span>**32.5 UBX Message Flow**

There are certain features associated with the messages being sent back and forth:

## <span id="page-186-1"></span>**32.5.1 Acknowledgement**

When messages from the class CFG are sent to the receiver, the receiver will send an "acknowledge" ([UBX-ACK-ACK](#page-193-0)) or a "not acknowledge" ([UBX-ACK-NAK](#page-193-0)) message back to the sender, depending on whether or not the message was processed correctly.

Some messages from other classes (e.g. LOG) also use the same acknowledgement mechanism.

## <span id="page-186-2"></span>**32.5.2 Polling Mechanism**

All messages that are output by the receiver in a periodic manner (i.e. messages in classes MON, NAV and RXM) and Get/Set type messages, such as the messages in the CFG class, can also be polled.

The UBX protocol is designed so that messages can be polled by sending the message required to the receiver but without a payload (or with just a single parameter that identifies the poll request). The receiver then responds with the same message with the payload populated.

## <span id="page-186-3"></span>**32.6 UBX Class IDs**

A class is a grouping of messages which are related to each other. The following table lists all the current message classes.

|             | â¢ It is necessary for at least one major GNSS to be enabled, after applying the            |
|             | new configuration to the current one.                                                      |
|             | â¢ It is also required that at least 4 tracking channels are available to each              |
|             | enabled major GNSS, i.e. maxTrkCh must have a minimum value of 4 for each                  |
|             | enabled major GNSS.                                                                        |

â¢ The number of tracking channels in use must not exceed the number of



tracking channels available in hardware, and the sum of all reserved tracking channels needs to be less than or equal to the number of tracking channels in use. Notes: â¢ To avoid cross-correlation issues, it is recommended that GPS and QZSS are always both enabled or both disabled. â¢ Polling this message returns the configuration of all supported GNSS, whether enabled or not; it may also include GNSS unsupported by the particular product, but in such cases the enable flag will always be unset. â¢ See section [GNSS Configuration](#page-26-0) for a discussion of the use of this message. â¢ See section [Satellite Numbering](#page-460-1) for a description of the GNSS IDs available. â¢ Applying the GNSS system configuration takes some time. After issuing UBX-CFG-GNSS, wait first for the acknowledgement from the receiver and then 0.5 seconds before sending the next command. â¢ If Galileo is enabled, UBX-CFG-GNSS must be followed by [UBX-CFG-CFG](#page-207-1) to save current configuration to BBR and then by [UBX-CFG-RST](#page-270-1) with resetMode set to Hardware reset. â¢ Configuration specific to the GNSS system can be done via other messages (e. g. **UBX-CFG-SBAS**).

Position and speed filtering also have a minimum time<br>interval. A position is logged if any of the thresholds are exceeded. If a threshold<br>is set to zero it is ignored. The maximum rate of position logging is 1 Hz.<br>The filter settings will be configured to the provided values only if the<br>'applyAllFilterSettings' flag is set. This allows the recording to be<br>enabled/disabled independently of configuring the filter settings.<br>Configuring the data logger in the absence of a logging file is supported.

| Comment           |                             | This message allows the user to alter the rate at which navigation solutions (and<br>the measurements that they depend on) are generated by the receiver. The<br>calculation of the navigation solution will always be aligned to the top of a<br>second zero (first second of the week) of the configured reference time system.<br>(Navigation period is an integer multiple of the measurement period in protocol<br>versions greater than 17).<br>â¢ Each measurement triggers the measurements generation and, if available,<br>raw data output.<br>â¢ The navRate value defines that every nth measurement triggers a navigation<br>epoch.<br>â¢ The update rate has a direct influence on the power consumption. The more<br>fixes that are required, the more CPU power and communication resources are<br>required.<br>â¢ For most applications a 1 Hz update rate would be sufficient.<br>â¢ When using power save mode, measurement and navigation rate can differ<br>from the values configured here. |                                                            |       |    |  |                |                                                                                            |         |                     |

| active        | If set enable time pulse; if pin assigned to another function, other function takes precedence.         |
|               | Must be set for FTS variant.                                                                            |
| lockGnssFreq  | If set, synchronize time pulse to GNSS as soon as GNSS time is valid. If not set, or before GNSS time   |
|               | is valid, use local clock.                                                                              |
|               | This flag is ignored by the FTS product variant; in this case the receiver always locks to the best     |
|               | available time/frequency reference (which is not necessarily GNSS).                                     |
|               | This flag can be unset only in Timing product variants.                                                 |
| lockedOtherSe | If set the receiver switches between the timepulse settings given by 'freqPeriodLocked' &               |
| t             | 'pulseLenLocked' and those given by 'freqPeriod' & 'pulseLen'. The 'Locked' settings are used where     |
|               | the receiver has an accurate sense of time. For non-FTS products, this occurs when GNSS solution        |
|               | with a reliable time is available, but for FTS products the setting syncMode field governs behavior. In |
|               | all cases, the receiver only uses 'freqPeriod' & 'pulseLen' when the flag is unset.                     |
| isFreq        | If set 'freqPeriodLock' and 'freqPeriod' are interpreted as frequency, otherwise interpreted as period. |
| isLength      | If set 'pulseLenRatioLock' and 'pulseLenRatio' interpreted as pulse length, otherwise interpreted as    |
|               | duty cycle.                                                                                             |
| alignToTow    | Align pulse to top of second (period time must be integer fraction of 1s).                              |
|               | Also set 'lockGnssFreq' to use this feature.                                                            |
|               | This flag is ignored by the FTS product variant; it is assumed to be always set (as is lockGnssFreq).   |
|               | Set maxSlewRate and maxPhaseCorrRate fields of UBX-CFG-SMGR to 0 to disable alignment.                  |
| polarity      | Pulse polarity:                                                                                         |

| Comment     | This message can be used for a time-based search of a log. It can find the index<br>of the first log entry with time equal to the given time, otherwise the index of the<br>most recent entry with time less than the given time. This index can then be<br>used with the UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE message to provide time-based retrieval of<br>log entries.<br>Searching a log is effective for a given time later than the base date (January<br>1st, 2004). Searching a log for a given time earlier than the base date will result<br>in an 'entry not found' response. (Searching a log for a given time earlier than the<br>base date will result in a UBX-ACK-NAK message in protocol versions less than<br>18).<br>Searching a log for a given time greater than the last recorded entry's time will<br>return the index of the last recorded entry. (If the logging has stopped due to<br>lack of file space, such a search will result in a UBX-ACK-NAK message in |

If the odometer was enabled at<br>the time a position was logged, then message UBX-LOG-RETRIEVEPOSEXTRA will<br>also be used. The maximum number of entries that can be returned in response<br>to a single UBX-LOG-RETRIEVE message is 256. If more entries than this are<br>required the message will need to be sent multiple times with different<br>startNumbers. The retrieve will be stopped if any UBX-LOG message is received.<br>The speed of transfer can be maximized by using a high data rate and<br>temporarily stopping the GPS processing (see UBX-CFG-RST). |                                                                                                                                                                                              |       |         |  |                |                                                                                            |         |                     |  |  |  |

| Comment                              |                  |       | This message is used to transfer a block of MGA-ANO data from host to the<br>receiver. Upon reception of this message, the receiver will write the payload data<br>to its internal non-volatile memory (flash). Also, on reception of the first MGA<br>FLASH-DATA message, the receiver will erase the flash allocated to storing any<br>existing MGA-ANO data. The payload can be up to 512 bytes. Payloads larger<br>than this would exceed the receiver's internal buffering capabilities. The receiver<br>will ACK/NACK this message using the message alternatives given below. The<br>host shall wait for an acknowledge message before sending the next data block.<br>See Flash-based AssistNow Offline for details. |         |      |            |                |                                                                                            |         |                     |  |

| jammingState | Output from jamming/interference monitor (0 = unknown or feature disabled or flag unavailable, 1 =      |
|              | ok - no significant jamming, 2 = warning - interference visible but fix OK, 3 = critical - interference |
|              | visible and no fix). This flag is deprecated in protocol versions that support UBX-SEC-SIG (version     |
|              | 0x02) and always reported as 0; instead jammingState in UBX-SEC-SIG should be monitored.                |
| xtalAbsent   | RTC xtal has been determined to be absent (not supported in protocol versions less than 18)             |

|               | also where the detector is triggered the most. I.e. a value of 1 - No spoofing indicated does not mean |

| Comment     | Frequency and/or phase measurement of synchronization sources. The                        |
|             | measurements are relative to the nominal frequency and nominal phase.                     |
|             | The receiver reports the measurements on its sync sources using this message.             |
|             | Which measurements are reported can be configured using UBX-CFG-SMGR.                     |
|             | The host may report offset of the receiver's outputs with this message as well.           |
|             | The receiver has to be configured using UBX-CFG-SMGR to enable the use of the             |
|             | external measurement messages. Otherwise the receiver will ignore them.                   |

| Comment           |                  | Calibrate (measure) gain of the voltage controlled oscillator. The calibration is<br>performed by varying the raw oscillator control values between the limits<br>specified in raw0 and raw1. maxStepSize is the largest step change that can be<br>used during the calibration process. The "raw values" are either PWM duty cycle<br>values or DAC values depending on how the VCTCXO is connected to the<br>system. The measured gain is the transfer function<br>dRelativeFrequencyChange/dRaw (not dFrequency/dVoltage). The calibration<br>process works as follows:<br>Starting from the current raw output the control value is changed in the<br>direction of raw0 in steps of size at most maxStepSize. Then the frequency is<br>measured and the control value is changed towards raw1, again in steps of<br>maxStepSize. When raw1 is reached, the frequency is again measured and the<br>message version DATA0 is output containing the measured result. Normal<br>operation then resumes. If the control value movement is less than maxStepSize<br>then the transition will happen in one step - this will give fast calibration.<br>Care must be taken when calibrating the internal oscillator against the GNSS<br>source. In that case the changes applied to the oscillator frequency could be<br>severe enough to lose satellite signal tracking, especially when signals are weak.<br>If too many signals are lost, the GNSS system will lose its fix and be unable to<br>measure the oscillator frequency - the calibration will then fail. In this case<br>maxStepSize must be reasonably small.<br>It is also important that only the chosen frequency source is enabled during the<br>calibration process and that it remains stable throughout the calibration period;<br>otherwise incorrect oscillator measurements will be made and this will lead to<br>miscalibration and poor subsequent operation of the receiver. |                                  |                |    |                                                                                  |                |                                                                                                                                                                          |         |                     |  |

## <span id="page-455-0"></span>**33 RTCM Protocol**

The RTCM (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services) protocol is a protocol that is used to supply the GNSS receiver with real-time differential correction data. The RTCM protocol specification is available from [http://www.rtcm.org.](http://www.rtcm.org)

## <span id="page-455-1"></span>**33.1 RTCM2**

## <span id="page-455-2"></span>**33.1.1 Introduction**

This feature is only applicable to GPS operation.

- This feature only supports code differential positioning.
- For effective differential positioning accuracy, it is necessary that the reference station antenna is situated in a low multipath environment with an unobstructed view of the sky. It is recommended that reference receiver applies phase smoothing to the broadcast corrections.

This feature is not available with the High Precision GNSS products.

## <span id="page-455-3"></span>**33.1.2 Supported Messages**

The following RTCM 2.3 messages are supported:

| Message | Description                  |
|---------|------------------------------|
| Type    |                              |
| 1       | Differential GPS Corrections |
| 2       | Delta Differential GPS       |

9 GPS Partial Correction Set

## **Supported RTCM 2.3 Message Types**

Corrections 3 GPS Reference Station Parameters

## <span id="page-455-4"></span>**33.1.3 Configuration**

The DGPS feature does not need any configuration to work properly. When an RTCM stream is input on any of the communication interfaces, the data will be parsed and applied if possible, which will put the receiver into DGPS mode.

The only configurable parameter of DGPS mode is the timeout that can be specified using [UBX-](#page-230-1)[CFG-NAV5](#page-230-1). This value defines the time after which old RTCM data will be discarded.

The RTCM protocol can be disabled/enabled on communication interfaces by means of the [UBX-](#page-257-1)[CFG-PRT](#page-257-1) message. By default, RTCM is enabled.

## <span id="page-455-5"></span>**33.1.4 Output**

DGPS mode will result in following modified output:

â¢ [NMEA-GGA](#page-161-1): The quality field will be 2 (see [NMEA Positon Fix Flags](#page-155-1)). The age of DGPS corrections and Reference station ID will be set.



- [NMEA-GLL](#page-163-1), [NMEA-RMC](#page-171-1), [NMEA-VTG](#page-175-1), [NMEA-GNS](#page-165-1): The posMode indicator will be D (see [NMEA Positon](#page-155-1) [Fix Flags\)](#page-155-1).
- [NMEA-PUBX-POSITION](#page-178-1): The status will be D2/D3; The age of DGPS corrections will be set.
- [UBX-NAV-SOL](#page-400-1): The DGPS flag will be set.
- [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1): The diffSoln flag will be set.
- [UBX-NAV-STATUS](#page-402-1): The diffSoln flag will be set; the diffCorr flag will be set.
- [UBX-NAV-SVINFO](#page-404-1): The DGPS flag will be set for channels with valid DGPS correction data.
- [UBX-NAV-DGPS](#page-374-1): This message will contain all valid DGPS data
- If the base line exceeds 100 km and a message type 3 is received, a [UBX-INF-WARNING](#page-307-1) will be output, e.g. "WARNING: DGNSS baseline big: 330.3km"

## <span id="page-456-0"></span>**33.1.5 Restrictions**

The following restrictions apply to DGPS mode:

- The DGPS solution will only include measurements from satellites for which DGPS corrections were provided. This is because the navigation algorithms cannot mix corrected with uncorrected measurements.
- [SBAS corrections](#page-29-1) will not be applied when using RTCM correction data.
- Precise Point Positioning will be deactivated when using RTCM correction data.
- RTCM correction data cannot be applied when using AssistNow Offline or AssistNow Autonomous.

## <span id="page-456-1"></span>**33.1.6 Reference**

The RTCM2 support is implemented according to RTCM 10402.3 ("RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR DIFFERENTIAL GNSS").

## <span id="page-456-2"></span>**33.2 RTCM version 3**

(Note: the RTCM3 protocol is not supported in [protocol versions less than 20\)](#page-15-2).

## <span id="page-458-1"></span>**33.2.4 Configuration**

The configuration of the RTK rover and reference station is explained in the [RTK Mode](#page-110-0) [Configuration](#page-110-0) section.

The RTCM3 protocol can be disabled/enabled on communication interfaces by means of the UBX-CFG-PRT message. By default, RTCM3 is enabled.

The configuration of the RTCM3 correction stream must be done according to the following rules:

- The RTCM3 stream must contain a reference station message (type 1005 or type 1006) in addition to the GNSS observation messages.
- The RTCM3 stream must contain a reference station message (type 1005, type 1006, or [type](#page-14-0) [4072, sub-type 0](#page-14-0)) in addition to the GNSS observation messages.
- All observation messages must be broadcast at the same rate.
- The reference station ID field in the GNSS observation messages must be consistent with the reference station ID field in the reference station message otherwise the rover will not be able to compute its position.
- The RTCM3 stream must contain the GLONASS code-phase biases message (type 1230) otherwise the GLONASS ambiguities can only be estimated as float unless the receiver is able to identify the code-phase bias from receiver descriptor message (RTCM 1033), even in RTK fixed mode.
- The static reference station message (type 1005 or type 1006) does not need to be broadcast at the same rate as the observation messages but the rover will not be able to compute its position until it has received a valid reference station message.
- The moving baseline reference message ([type 4072, sub-type 0](#page-14-0)) must be broadcast at the same rate as the observation messages.
- The RTCM3 stream should only contain one type of observation messages per constellation. When using a multi-constellation configuration, all constellations should use the same type of observation messages. Mixing RTK and MSM messages will result in undefined rover behavior.
- The moving baseline reference message ([type 4072, sub-type 0](#page-14-0)) should only be used in combination with MSM7 observation messages.
- If the receiver is configured to output RTCM messages on several ports, they must all have the same RTCM configuration otherwise the MSM multiple message bit might not be set properly.





## <span id="page-459-0"></span>**33.2.5 Output**

RTK Rover and MB Rover Modes will result in following modified output:

- [NMEA-GGA](#page-161-1): The quality field will be 4 for RTK fixed and 5 for RTK float (see [NMEA Positon Fix](#page-155-1) [Flags](#page-155-1)). The age of differential corrections and reference station ID will be set.
- [NMEA-GLL](#page-163-1), [NMEA-VTG](#page-175-1): The posMode indicator will be D for RTK float and RTK fixed (see [NMEA](#page-155-1) [Positon Fix Flags](#page-155-1)).
- [NMEA-RMC](#page-171-1), [NMEA-GNS](#page-165-1): The posMode indicator will be F for RTK float and R for RTK fixed (see [NMEA Positon Fix Flags](#page-155-1)).
- [UBX-NAV-PVT](#page-389-1): The carrSoln flag will be set to 1 for RTK float and 2 for RTK fixed.
- [UBX-NAV-RELPOSNED](#page-393-1): The diffSoln and refPosValid flags will be set. The carrSoln flag will be set to 1 for RTK float and 2 for RTK fixed. In moving baseline rover mode, the isMoving flag will be set, and the refPosMiss and refObsMiss flags will be set for epochs during which extrapolated reference position or observations have been used.
- [UBX-NAV-SAT](#page-395-2): The diffCorr flag will be set for satellites with valid RTCM data. The rtcmCorrUsed, prCorrUsed, and crCorrUsed flags will be set for satellites for which the RTCM corrections have been applied. In moving baseline rover mode, the doCorrUsed flag will also be set.
- [UBX-NAV-STATUS](#page-402-1): The diffSoln flag will be set; the diffCorr flag will be set.
- If the baseline exceeds 10 km and a message type 1005, type 1006 or [type 4072, sub-type 0](#page-14-0) is received, a [UBX-INF-WARNING](#page-307-1) will be output, e.g. "WARNING: DGNSS baseline big: 12.7km"

## <span id="page-460-2"></span>**B UBX and NMEA Signal Identifiers**

UBX and NMEA protocols use signal identifiers (commonly abbreviated as "sigId") to distinguish between different signals from GNSS.

Signal identifiers are only valid when combined with a GNSS identifier (see [above](#page-460-1)). The table below shows the range of identifiers currently supported in the firmware.

## <span id="page-460-3"></span>**C u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 Default Settings**

The default settings listed in this section apply to u-blox 8 / u-blox M8 receivers. These values assume that the default levels of the configuration pins have been left unchanged and no setting that affects the default configuration was written to the eFuse. Default settings are dependent on the configuration pin and eFuse settings. For information regarding these settings, consult the applicable data sheet.

If nothing else is mentioned, the default settings apply to u-blox 8 and u-blox M8 receivers.
