## <span id="page-1-1"></span>**3 New features**

No new features.

# <span id="page-1-2"></span>**4 Dropped features**

<span id="page-1-3"></span>No dropped features.

## **5 Functional improvements**

- Improved MSM correction stream handling
  - o Extended capability to handle MSM correction streams, also including messages other than the ones supported by the receiver (GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou).
  - o Extended capability to handle MSM correction streams including SBAS messages.
- Improved M8P base station BDS D2 encoding
  - o Extended support for BDS\_B1ID2 signals on GEO satellites.

### <span id="page-1-4"></span>**6 Known limitations**

- A change in reference station ID for a reference station providing GLONASS corrections, combined with concurrent data outage (e.g., in case of a temporarily broken communication link) could occasionally result in mixing the correction data of the new reference station with position data from a prior reference station. As a possible consequence, position errors may be temporarily observed.
- A NEO-M8P rover can use corrections from a ZED-F9P reference station only if the latter is configured to deliver GPS and GLONASS corrections.

## <span id="page-1-5"></span>**7 Changed default configuration**

- The revision ID in the software version string (boot screen, UBX-MON-VER message) now displays a hexadecimal instead of a decimal number.
- The default value for GPS leap seconds (UBX-CFG-NAVX5.leapSec) and GPS week number rollover (UBX-CFG-NAVX5.wknRollover) has been updated to reflect the time of release.
