**for u-blox 5, 6, 7, 8 and M8 GNSS receivers Application Note**

### **Abstract**

Many u-blox receivers read the GPS date and time from the GPS L1 C/A signal. Unfortunately the date information in this signal is ambiguous, and rotates in cycles of 19.6 years. Thus the receiver may show a 20 or 40 year old date when it translates the current GPS date to human-readable form.

This document describes the background of this issue and recommends workarounds for it.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**1 GPS week number roll-over issue**

The GPS system counts time in weeks since Sunday, 6 January 1980. A GNSS receiver reads this week number for the current date from the GPS L1 C/A signal and then translates it to traditional date presentation. E.g. the NMEA GPRMC message displays the current day, month and year.

Unfortunately the GPS L1 C/A signal presents the GPS week number with only 10 bits. Thus, the week number rolls from 1023 to 0 every 19.6 years. It has now rolled over twice since start of the GPS era in January 1980. These roll-overs have happened in August 1999, and now recently in April 2019. The next one will happen in November 2038.

If the receiver uses only the GPS L1 C/A signal there is no way of knowing how many times the week number has already rolled over, so the receiver cannot know if week number 10 means 16 Mar 1980, 31 Oct 1999, or 16 Jun 2019. The receiver tries to determine the correct date, but it may show a 20 year-old or 40-year-old date.

Multi-GNSS and multi-band receivers are more robust regarding this issue because they have additional methods for solving the ambiguity of the current date. The GLONASS, Galileo, and GPS L2C and L5 satellites provide unambiguous date information.

Fortunately the human-readable date is reported only for convenience of the end user. It is not used internally by the receiver. An error in the human-readable date does not impact any navigation function, time of day information or time pulse accuracy. However, such wrong dates look bad to the end user, and may even break some applications that rely on knowing the correct date.

To mitigate the impact of the GPS week number roll-over, u-blox has adopted the common industry practice of delaying the GPS week number roll-over impact until about 20 years from the receiver firmware creation. All u-blox receivers are performing well after the recent April 2019 GPS week number roll-over. Any impact will be visible only later on.

### <span id="page-3-1"></span>**1.1 Compensating algorithms**

Modern GPS receivers use various methods for mitigating the week number roll-over issue. Because the receiver knows that it was manufactured after year 1999, it can add 1024 to the 10-bit week number to get the actual GPS week number. Some very old receivers do only this simple compensation, and they can present week numbers from 1024 (Sunday 1999-08-22) to 2047 (up to Saturday 2019-04-06). On Sunday 2019-04-07 (GPS week number 2048), such receivers started to report dates from August 1999.

u-blox receivers have adopted the common industry practice of using an additional compensation value to postpone the impact of the 10-bit week number roll-over to some future date beyond the week number 2047 (up to Saturday 2019-04-06). The receiver compares the week number of the receiver firmware creation date with the current 10-bit GPS L1 C/A week number. If the current 10-bit week number is same or greater than the corresponding week number for the firmware creation date, the receiver adds 1024 weeks to this 10-bit week number to get actual GPS week number. If the 10 bit week number is less than the corresponding week number for the firmware creation date, the receiver adds 2 \* 1024 to this 10-bit week number to get past the second GPS week number roll-over on 2019-04-06.

For example, u-blox 6 receiver firmware version 7.03 was released on 2011-03-17 and it has week number roll-over compensation value of 1603 for Sunday 2010-09-26. (The compensation value is some months earlier than the release date because firmware verification and characterization must be stared well before the release.) With this compensation value the receiver reports correct dates from start of GPS week 1603 (Sunday 2010-09-26) to end of GPS week 2626 (1603 + 1023). GPS week 2626 ends on Saturday 2030-05-11. The receiver reports this date correctly, but when GPS week 2027 starts on Sunday 2030-05-12, it will report the date as Sunday 2010-09-26.



# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**2 Workarounds**

There are several ways to mitigate the impact of the GPS week number roll-over.

The first thing to do is to recognize that the roll-over will have an impact on every GPS receiver at some point. Application designers need to realize this, and make any necessary preparations.

### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**2.1 Host processor date adjustment algorithm**

The most robust workaround for the GPS week number roll-over issue is to add a compensation algorithm to the customer application running on the host processor. The algorithm accepts the wrong date from the receiver, and then translates that to the correct date before passing it further in the application stack. Appendix [A](#page-5-0) provides efficient sample code for such an algorithm.

### <span id="page-4-2"></span>**2.2 Adjustable week number roll-over compensation value**

All current u-blox receivers have an internal adjustable GPS week number roll-over compensation value. This value is used for delaying the impact of the roll-over for about 20 years from the receiver firmware creation date. The default value for this GPS week number roll-over compensation is included in the firmware defaults. See Appendix [B](#page-8-0) for lists of default values for the compensation in each u-blox receiver firmware version.

The firmware default value for the compensation can be overridden with an UBX-message (since u-blox receiver generation 5, firmware version 5). This message must either be sent on every receiver startup, or the setting can be stored as part of receiver configuration in non-volatile memory.

A simple solution for a customer application is to set this compensation value to 2047 (Sunday 2019- 03-31). This enables the receiver to display correct dates up to Saturday 2038-11-13 (end of GPS week 3070, which is 2047+1023). On Sunday 2038-11-14 (start of GPS week 3071) the receiver will display the date as 2019-03-21. Appendi[x B](#page-8-0) lists the needed UBX messages for this setting.

Please note that the 32-bit Unix-time used in many embedded applications will wrap from January 19th in 2038 to December 13th 1901. u-blox receivers do not use the 32-bit Unix-time and are not impacted by this issue. However, any application that has very long life span should be reviewed and tested also for this separate time handling issue.

### <span id="page-4-3"></span>**2.3 Firmware update**

The latest firmware version has the most recent GPS week number roll-over compensation value. Thus, updating the firmware of a receiver can postpone the impact of the roll-over.

Unfortunately, in many products the firmware cannot be updated. Even for products that have such an option, the update process is often not feasible, because the customer application may be a standalone application without a remote update possibility.

# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**B Week number roll-over compensation values**

### <span id="page-8-1"></span>**B.1 Default values**

The following table lists the GPS week number roll-over compensation value for each u-blox receiver firmware version. Every minor version of a major firmware version has same compensation value. The receiver displays the correct date on the time span between the start and end dates.

| Firmware | Week number | Start date | End date   |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 5.x      | 1460        | 2007-12-30 | 2027-08-14 |
| 6.x      | 1528        | 2009-04-19 | 2028-12-02 |
| 6.x      | 1528        | 2009-04-19 | 2028-12-02 |
| 7.x      | 1603        | 2010-09-26 | 2030-05-11 |
| 1.x      | 1691        | 2012-06-03 | 2032-01-17 |
| 7.x      | 1603        | 2010-09-26 | 2030-05-11 |
| 1.x      | 1691        | 2012-06-03 | 2032-01-17 |
| 2.0x     | 1756        | 2013-09-01 | 2033-04-16 |
| 3.0x     | 1867        | 2015-10-18 | 2035-06-02 |
| 3.5x     | 1936        | 2017-02-12 | 2036-09-27 |
|          |             |            |            |

**Table 1: Default GPS week number roll-over compensation values**

The firmware version of the receiver is displayed in the receiver boot-screen NMEA messages. It can also be queried by UBX-MON-VER message.

### <span id="page-8-2"></span>**B.2 UBX messages for adjustment**

The default GPS week number roll-over compensation value can be overwritten by the UBX-CFG-NAVX5 message. This message controls several navigation and timing aspects of the receiver. The bit number 9 in mask1 must be set to 1 and other mask bits must be left as 0 to limit the modification to the wknRollover value.

UBX-CFG-NAVX5 example:

```
uint16_t week = 2047;
uint8_t buf[6 + 40 + 2] = { 0xB5, 0x62, 0x06, 0x23, 40, 0 };
uint8_t *data = &buf[6];
data[2] = 0; // mask 1 lsb
data[2+1] = 1<<1; // mask 1 msb 00000010
data[18] = week & 0xff; // week lsb
data[18+1] = (week >> 8) & 0xff; // week msb
updateCheckSum(buf, sizeof buf);
```

If a flash memory or reliable battery backup is available, the current compensation value can be saved to non-volatile memory as part of the current configuration with UBX-CFG-CFG message. The subsection of navigation configuration, navConf, should be saved to store the current wknRollover value.

UBX-CFG-CFG example:

```
uint8_t buf[6 + 12 + 2] = { 0xB5, 0x62, 0x06, 0x09, 12, 0 };
 uint8_t *data = &buf[6];
 data[4] = 1<<3; // mask 1 lsb == 00001000
 updateCheckSum(buf, sizeof buf);
```
