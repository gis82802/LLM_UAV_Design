| Current Product Type No | Current Firmware version | New Product Type No | New Firmware version   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| NEO-M8P-0-10            | Flash FW 3.01 HPG 1.30   | NEO-M8P-0-11        | Flash FW 3.01 HPG 1.40 |

#### **3.1 FW upgrade**

<span id="page-0-0"></span>From the date indicated in the schedule in section [0,](#page-0-0) a new firmware release will be applied in production to the affected products. The new u-blox M8 Flash Firmware 3.01 HPG 1.40 includes the Moving Baseline feature. For full change details, see HPG 1.40 Release Note [1], NEO-M8P Data Sheet [2], and other documents listed in section [6.](#page-1-0)

## **4 Schedule**

| Product type number | Samples availability date | Estimated first shipment date1 |  |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--|
| NEO-M8P-0-11        | July 7th, 2017            | September 8, 2017              |  |
| NEO-M8P-2-11        | July 7th, 2017            | September 8, 2017              |  |

Documentation: See [Reference](#page-1-0) Documents

<sup>1</sup> The Estimated First Shipment Date is the forecasted date that a customer may expect to receive the changed product with the new Type Number. This is determined by the estimated date of inventory depletion on the PCN issue date. This may be affected by fluctuations in supply and demand. Consequently, although customers should be prepared to receive changed product on this date, u-blox will continue to ship pre-changed product until a time in which inventory has been depleted. This may result in pre-changed product being shipped to customers after this forecasted date.



### **5 Customer Impact and Recommended Action**

The new product firmware introduces a new feature, support for the Moving Baseline setup. The new firmware functions in a very similar way as the old one. u-blox has taken all measures to insure HPG 1.40 is backward compatible with the FW HPG 1.30. However, u-blox recommends that the customer confirm compatible behavior in their application as soon as samples or firmware become available.

The new product is electrically compatible with the old product and physically conformant with the old specification.

For new designs, u-blox recommends that any qualification process is completed using parts with the new firmware.
