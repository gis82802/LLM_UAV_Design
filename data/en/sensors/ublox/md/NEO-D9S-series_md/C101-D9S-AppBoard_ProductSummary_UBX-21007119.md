# **Highlights**

- Application board for NEO-D9S
- Flexible connectivity options, including USB and UART
- Arduino Mega shield connections for host expansion

## **Product description**

The C101-D9S application board allows easy evaluation of NEO-D9S, the u-blox L-band GNSS correction data receiver module.

The NEO-D9S module is an L-band satellite data receiver for GNSS correction service broadcasts which can be configured for use with a variety of correction services.

NEO-D9S decodes the satellite transmission, which can be decrypted and converted to corrections on the host processor, enabling a high precision GNSS receiver to reach accuracies down to centimeter level.

The C101-D9S application board has a built-in USB interface for both power supply and NEO-D9S module data transfer.

The u-center evaluation software provides a powerful platform for evaluating u-blox GNSS and L-band data receivers.
