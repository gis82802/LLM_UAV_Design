## **Product description**

NEO-D9S is a satellite data receiver for L-band correction broadcast that can be configured for use with a variety of correction services. It decodes the satellite transmission and outputs a correction stream, enabling a high precision GNSS receiver to reach accuracies down to centimeter level. Depending on the capabilities of the receiver used, it can consume the data output by NEO-D9S as is, or external preprocessing on the host might be needed. By providing an independent correction data stream delivered via satellite L-band, NEO-D9S ensures high availability of the position output and decreases dependency on cellular connectivity for correction service delivered via IP. Granting access to a broadcast data stream, NEO-D9S allows virtually infinite scalability, eliminating the need for a dedicated delivery channel per user. This makes NEO-D9S flexible for use in various markets and applications.

NEO-D9S is configurable for use with correction data of various providers and service levels. This ensures high precision in multiple regions globally, as well as coverage across continents.

NEO-D9S can be easily integrated with a variety of high precision GNSS receivers from the u-blox F9 platform, which allows a complete high precision solution to be built with less design effort. For more information about the u-blox F9 products, refer to the u-blox website.

In addition, NEO-D9S can be integrated in any high precision GNSS system that uses L-band correction delivery.

NEO-D9S implements u-blox security principles and advanced security features including signature and anti-jamming mechanisms, thus allowing reliable GNSS positioning in enduser products.

This L-band receiver is in the u-blox NEO form factor.
