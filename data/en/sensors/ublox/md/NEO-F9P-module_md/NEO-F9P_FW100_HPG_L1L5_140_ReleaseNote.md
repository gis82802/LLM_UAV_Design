# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**2 Firmware description**

This section highlights selected features supported by this firmware.

- The firmware image contains multi-band (L1/L5) RTK rover using all major GNSS constellations.
- The firmware image supports raw code and carrier phase measurement output for all supported GNSS signals.

#### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**2.1 Supported GNSS constellations and signals**

- GPS: L1C/A, L5
- GLONASS: L1OF
- Galileo: E1B/C, E5a
- BeiDou: B1I, B2a
- QZSS: L1C/A, L5
- NavIC: L5

All signals are enabled in the default configuration, except GPS L5 and NavIC L5.

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>**2.2 High precision GNSS features**

- RTK rover receiver features:
  - High precision RTK fixed navigation using multi-band, multi-constellation GNSS
  - RTCM input support (details below), supporting Network RTK (VRS) and local base stations, e.g. another NEO-F9P or ZED-F9P module
  - SPARTN input support for GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and Beidou with fast reconvergence time
  - CLAS input support for QZSS
    - The CLAS augmentation service is broadcasted by a QZSS L6 signal which is not part of the frequency range covered by NEO-F9P. As such, NEO-F9P does not support receiving, demodulating and decoding of the QZSS L6 signal. This is supported by NEO-D9C which then must pass the correction stream to NEO-F9P in the form of UBX-RXM-QZSSL6 messages. This enables the NEO-F9P to directly use these messages and extract the compact SSR (cSSR) formatted corrections in order to use them directly without further processing or reformatting by an intermediary.
    - At the time of this release note, a CLAS solution with NEO-F9P augments GPS L1C/A L5, QZSS L1S, and Galileo E5a
  - SBAS
- RTK reference receiver features:
  - Fixed position mode and Survey-in mode
  - Output RTCM standard format
- Raw measurements:
  - Multi-band, multi-GNSS raw measurement data output (UBX-RXM-RAWX)
  - Navigation data subframe output (UBX-RXM-SFRBX)
- Support of active and passive antennas
- UBX messages on all interfaces
- Protection Level output to indicate level of trust in position output
- Secondary standard precision GNSS output in addition to RTK output
- Jamming detector with logging
- Embedded spectrum analyzer to visualize in-band noise sources



- Direct physical connection with L-band receiver
- Option to use GPS L5 signals



# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**3 Message interface**

The message interface is described in the NEO-F9P FW 1.00 HPG L1L5 1.40 Interface description, UBX-23006991. The released firmware supports UBX protocol version 27.40.

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>**3.1 UBX**

The NEO-F9P relies exclusively on the configuration interface using the UBX-CFG-VALSET, UBX-CFG\_VALGET and UBX-CFG-VALDEL. Although some undocumented legacy UBX-CFG-\* messages are functional, users are strongly discouraged from using these deprecated messages.

The protocol is completely documented in the Interface description.

#### <span id="page-6-2"></span>**3.2 NMEA**

NEO-F9P FW 1.00 HPG L1L5 1.40 supports up to NMEA protocol version 4.11.

Five NMEA standards are supported. The default NMEA version is 4.11, and, alternatively, versions 4.10, 4.0, 2.3, and 2.1 can be enabled.

#### <span id="page-6-3"></span>**3.3 RTCM**

NEO-F9P FW 1.00 HPG L1L5 1.40 supports up to RTCM3 standard version 3.3.

#### <span id="page-6-4"></span>**3.4 SPARTN**

NEO-F9P FW 1.00 HPG L1L5 1.40 supports up to SPARTN protocol version 2.0.1.



# <span id="page-7-0"></span>**4 Known limitations**

- A receiver moving at very slow speed (less than 10 cm/s) does not update the heading information in UBX-NAV-PVT. The velocity vectors can be used reliably.
- Geofence status pin must not be re-assigned to another pin
- If the receiver is configured to output RTCM messages on several ports, the ports must have the same RTCM configuration, otherwise the MSM multiple message bit might not be set correctly
- Time pulse can only be synced to GNSS. Configuration items and relevant flag cannot be set to false (CFG-TP-SYNC\_GNSS\_TP1, UBX-CFG-TP5)
