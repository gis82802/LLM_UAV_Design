### **Product description**

The NEO-F9P positioning module features the u-blox F9 receiver platform, which provides multi-band GNSS positioning to high-volume industrial applications in a small form factor. NEO-F9P is a multi-band GNSS module with integrated u-blox multi-band RTK technology for centimeterlevel accuracy. The module enables precise navigation and automation of moving industrial machinery by means of a small, surface-mounted module.

The NEO-F9P module is designed for easy integration and low design-in costs with minimal eBOM. Thanks to its small package size, light weight, and small power consumption it is well-suited for mass market adoption.

NEO-F9P ensures the security of positioning and navigation information by using secured interfaces and advanced jamming and spoofing and mitigation detection technologies. NEO-F9P offers support for a range of open correction services allowing each application to optimize performance according to the application's individual needs. NEO-F9P comes with built-in support for standard RTCM corrections, supporting centimeter-level navigation from local base stations or from virtual reference stations (VRS) in a Network RTK setup. The module also uses PPP-RTK services suitable for mass-market applications formatted as SPARTN.

u-blox modules are manufactured in ISO/TS 16949 certified sites and are fully tested on a system level. Qualification tests are performed as stipulated in the ISO16750 standard: "Road vehicles – Environmental conditions and testing for electrical and electronic equipment".
