**ZED-F9H**

### **Product description**

The ZED-F9H module is designed to provide the best possible heading information to applications where precise attitude is of greatest importance.

The ZED-F9H acts as an accompanying module, and requires a ZED-F9P module to be mounted on the same vehicle. In this setup, ZED-F9P provides the precise GNSS position, and at the same time acts as a moving base to the ZED-F9H module, which in turn outputs the precise attitude information.

As the heading information is based on GNSS it does not require pre-calibration, thus ensuring easy production, integration and operation. The precise heading information is always available, even in stand-still situations.

ZED-F9H is designed to lower the system cost for a heading application and comes with minimal e-BOM. Thanks to its small package size, light weight, and low power consumption it is well-suited for mass market adoption.

u-blox modules are manufactured in ISO/TS 16949 certified sites and are fully tested on a system level. Qualification tests are performed as stipulated in the ISO16750 standard: "Road vehicles – Environmental conditions and testing for electrical and electronic equipment".
