# <span id="page-1-4"></span>**2 New features**

When migrating from the previous version of the product, users are advised to perform retesting in their system.

### <span id="page-1-5"></span>**2.1 Rail and tram use case support**

Vehicle behaving as rail vehicle and trams can calibrate the inertial navigation system for applications requiring a meter level of accuracy. The system must provide a wheel tick and direction signal and must be manually aligned in the vehicle. The tolerance of the mounting alignment may be set to high or low using CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG\_TOLERANCE. This provides a tradeoff between faster sensor fusion calibration times versus the effort required to properly mount the system.

Compared to a system using only a GNSS receiver, this solution improves the availability of the position even when the sky view is completely obstructed. Furthermore, the system can output the heading and attitude even where it is at standstill.

#### <span id="page-1-6"></span>**2.2 SPARTN 2.0.2 with Beidou & QZSS**

Secure Position Augmentation for Real Time Navigation (SPARTN) is an open standard format available at [https://www.spartnformat.org/.](https://www.spartnformat.org/)

In addition to GPS, GLONASS and Galileo, this SPARTN release also supports corrections for BDS and QZSS.



# <span id="page-2-0"></span>**2.3 Improved modelling for SPARTN services during high ionospheric activity**

This firmware includes improvements in the ambiguity resolution algorithms that provide increased robustness and reliability during periods of high solar activity while using SPARTN correction services. This implementation is equivalent to the algorithms found in ZED-F9P-05B with the HPS1.51 firmware.

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**2.4 Lever arm support**

In systems where the level of accuracy is comparable to the offsets between the various reference points like GNSS antenna phase center, IMU reference frame, middle of the vehicle rear axle, these offsets need to be specified generally referred to as lever arms. In previous releases of the product, the lever arms were confidential messages reserved for advanced users. These messages are now publicly available to user and supported by u-center.

## <span id="page-2-2"></span>**2.5 Support of RTCM 3.4 corrections**

When operating in the RTK mode with RTCM corrections, this firmware now supports RTCM version 3.4 messages.

## <span id="page-2-3"></span>**2.6 Conservative Ambiguity Resolution mode**

This firmware includes a new option that can be selected via CFG-NAVHPG-DGNSSMODE, value 5 (RTK\_CAR), for a Conservative Ambiguity Resolution approach. When enabled, the occurrence of false RTK fixes is reduced, especially within challenging environments where disturbances such as multipath may be present. Please note that, depending on conditions, the time to ambiguity fix may be longer when the conservative mode is in use.

By default, this option is disabled. The firmware starts up with the default value 3 (RTK\_FIXED)

# <span id="page-2-4"></span>**2.7 Filtering of vibration impacting IMU**

In systems where there is strong undamped mechanical vibration affecting the quality of IMU data sufficient to impact sensor fusion performance, an optional digit filter is available to partially mitigate the issue. The presence of this kind of vibration can be confirmed by observing the level of noise reported by the UBX-ESF-STATUS message. By default, the filter is disabled. The filter is enabled by setting CFG-MOT-IMU\_FILT\_WINDOW to a non-zero value. For typical applications, 100 [ms] is suitable.

# <span id="page-2-5"></span>**3 Message interface**

### <span id="page-2-6"></span>**3.1 UBX protocol**

This firmware supports UBX protocol version 33.40.

#### <span id="page-2-7"></span>**3.2 NMEA protocol**

NMEA version 4.11 is the default and is unchanged.

#### <span id="page-3-1"></span>**3.5 Removed messages**

**Message / Configuration item Description / Comment**

# <span id="page-3-2"></span>**3.6 Firmware changes**

- Low-level system errors were corrected to output in all ports
- SPARTN keys now switch to the next one even if the "valid from ToW" (i.e. start of the week) value is zero
- Corrected an issue where PointPerfect keys incorrectly switched when the server sent messages with GLONASS timetags. This caused the key switch to happen 3 hours too early



when the PointPerfect service sent a stream with GLONASS messages. Consequently, there was a 3-hour period during which the decrypted messages were invalid.

- Corrected some NMEA messages with a missing talker ID.
- Corrected the content of UBX-MON-RF messages to be compatible with u-center.

# <span id="page-4-0"></span>**4 Known limitations**

#### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**4.1.1 Known firmware limitations**

- The system signal configuration performed by CFG-SIGNAL-\* immediately after startup may be ignored until the next GNSS restart. Configuring to flash is a workaround.
- NMEA GxGRS and GxGNS messages may exceed the 82-character limit to 85 characters.
- Signal configuration may be ignored if sent immediately after startup.
- NMEA GNGNS posMode field reports the same status for all GNSSs, not per GNSS.

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>**4.1.2 Known hardware limitations**

- It may not be possible to certify the USB interface according to the USB standard.
- The I2C has an issue with the setup time when used with clock stretching. It is recommended to use the fast mode.
