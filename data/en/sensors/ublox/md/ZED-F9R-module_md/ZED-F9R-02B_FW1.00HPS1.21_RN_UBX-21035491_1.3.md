## **2 New features**

## **2.1 SPARTN 1.8**

SPARTN, Safe Position Augmentation for Real-Time Navigation, is an open-standard format available at [https://www.spartnformat.org/.](https://www.spartnformat.org/)

A service provider using SPARTN-formatted corrections can enable high precision positioning applications with ZED-F9R. Compared to RTCM, which is used primarily for OSR, SPARTN has a complete set of messages suitable for SSR models without the use of vendor-specific messages. The use of SSR in the foundation allows services to be efficiently delivered over a broadcast medium such as L-band satellite signal or cellular networks. This allows a product to be deployed anywhere on the continent with a single service provider.

This release of SPARTN supports corrections for GPS and GLONASS and relies on a host library to decrypt the services, if necessary.

### **2.2 E-scooter dynamic model**

The dynamic model for an electric scooter often found in cities is available for the dead reckoning algorithm to improve the position accuracy in urban environments where GNSS signals are obstructed.

The purpose is to improve the accuracy in light urban environments to help police the user behavior to ensure compliance with local regulations in terms of operating in bike lanes and parking in designated areas. The E-scooter must be equipped with odometer readings and direction of travel information.

The model is tuned to the normal scooter operating behavior in terms of speed of travel, tilt, acceleration, and roll. The calibration speed of the IMU has been reduced to match the vehicle type.

Please consult the data sheet for additional information.

The default configuration is an automotive dynamic model.



# **2.3 Robotic lawnmower dynamic model**

The dynamic model for a robotic lawnmower is often used in commercial and residential settings. By incorporating high precision GNSS technology into robotic lawnmower designs, the machine can operate more efficiently than the early generation designs which can mostly randomly wander around an area. More complex areas can be handled as the mower builds an internal map of the area that has been cut. In many cases, the need for the boundary wire is eliminated, dramatically reducing installation costs. The dead reckoning algorithm improves the position accuracy in typical garden environments where GNSS signals are obstructed by homes, fences, bushes, and trees.

The model is tuned to the normal operating behavior of a lawn mower in terms of speed of travel, tilt, acceleration, and roll. The calibration of the IMU has been reduced to match the machine type and can start calibration at speed as low as 0.6 km per hour. The RLM dynamic model requires wheel ticks with polarity from both rear wheels. Automatic wheel tick polarity detection should not be used.

Please consult the data sheet for additional information.

The firmware default is an automotive dynamic model.

# **3 Message interface**

### **3.1 UBX protocol**

This firmware supports UBX protocol version 33.21.

### **3.2 NMEA protocol**

NMEA version 4.11 is the default instead of version 4.10 as it was in the in previous release.

## **3.5 Removed messages**

No messages were removed.

### **3.6 Firmware changes**

#### **3.6.1 Improvements**

- I2C robustness improvements.
- Accommodate systems with large wheel tick quantization. This supports low-cost sensors especially useful for applications with small wheels.
- Corrected use of almanac information of non-GPS systems.
- Corrected uninitialized values reported by UBX-ESF-ALG.
- Improved handling when not in RTK fix or float solutions under strong signals where tracking loop is wrong and results in larger measurement errors.
- Improved NMEA messages potentially exceeding length limits in strict configuration.
- Improved handling of Galileo satellites with high eccentric orbits.
- Improved performance handling of RTCM messages with millisecond-ambiguous corrections (RTCM MT 1001, 1003, 1009, 1011, MSM1 to MSM3).
- Corrected output of NMEA GxGSV message under some corner cases with untracked satellites.
- Corrected output of NMEA GxGRS message in version 4.11 regarding signal ID.
- General firmware improvements to reduce exceptions due to configuration changes



 Incorrect status information when SBAS/SLAS is disabled without restart. Entering backup mode.

#### **3.6.2 Firmware known limitations**

- After exiting a tunnel, solution stays in dead reckoning mode longer than expected.
- System signal configuration performed by CFG-SIGNAL-\* immediately after startup may be ignored until the next GNSS restart. Configuring to flash is a workaround.
- NMEA GxVLW and GxTHS messages in version 2.3 where information in version 4.0 is present.
- NMEA GxGRS and GxGNS messages may exceed the 82-character limit to 85 characters.

#### **3.6.3 Hardware known limitations**

- USB interface may not be possible to certify according to the USB standard.
- I2C has setup time issue when used with clock stretching and using fast mode is recommended.
