# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**1 Integration manual overview**

This document is an important source of information on all aspects of ZED-F9R system, software and hardware design. The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for a successful integration of the receiver with the customer's end product.



# <span id="page-6-0"></span>**2 System description**

# <span id="page-6-1"></span>**2.1 Overview**

The ZED-F9R module with the u-blox F9 multi-band GNSS receiver features rapid convergence time within seconds. This mass-market component combines high precision positioning with highest availability, while making use of all four GNSS constellations simultaneously. It is the first sensor fusion module with an integrated inertial measurement unit (IMU) capable of high precision positioning. The sophisticated built-in algorithms fuse the IMU data, GNSS measurements, wheel ticks, and a dedicated dynamic model to provide accurate positioning where GNSS alone would fail.

The module operates under open sky, sidewalks, roads, in the wooded countryside, in difficult multi-path environments, and even in tunnels and underground parking. For modern autonomous robotic applications such as unmanned ground vehicles where control and availability are the keys to success, ZED-F9R is the ultimate solution.

The device is a turnkey solution eliminating the technical risk of integrating third-party libraries, precise positioning engines, and the multi-faceted hardware engineering aspects of radio frequency design and digital design. The u-blox approach provides a transparent evaluation of the positioning solution and clear lines of responsibility for design support while reducing supply chain complexity during production.

ZED-F9R offers support for a range of correction services allowing each application to optimize performance according to the application's unique needs. ZED-F9R comes with built-in support for RTCM-formatted corrections, enabling high precision navigation using internet or satellite data connectivity. From firmware version HPS 1.21 onwards, the product supports SSR-type correction services suitable for mass-market deployment.

ZED-F9R modules use GNSS chips qualified according to AECâQ100 and are manufactured in ISO/ TS 16949 certified sites. Qualification tests are performed as stipulated in the ISO16750 standard. The professional-grade ZED-F9R module adheres to industrial standard quality specifications and production flow.

## <span id="page-6-2"></span>**2.1.1 High precision sensor fusion (HPS)**

High precision sensor fusion (HPS) provides high-accuracy positioning in locations with poor or no GNSS coverage. HPS is based on sensor fusion dead reckoning (SFDR) technology, which combines multi-constellation GNSS measurements with the ZED-F9R's internal 6-axis IMU and wheel tick or speed.

ZED-F9R supports dynamic models that are also optimized for robotic lawn mower (RLM) and escooter applications.

Robotic lawnmower (RLM) ande-scooterdynamicsmodels are supportedfromfirmware version HPS 1.21 onwards

See the [HPS](#page-20-1) section in this document for more information.

## <span id="page-6-3"></span>**2.1.2 Priority navigation mode**

Priority navigation mode provides a low-latency position, velocity, and vehicle attitude solution to be output at a high rate by utilizing sensor-based propagation in between GNSS measurement updates, thus prioritizing the time-critical data.



See the Priority [navigation](#page-43-0) mode section in this document for more information.

## <span id="page-7-0"></span>**2.1.3 Correction services**

u-blox ZED-F9R can use different types of correction services which broadly fall into two categories, based either on an Observation Space Representation (OSR) or a State Space Representation (SSR) of the errors. These categories use different techniques, delivery mechanisms, and core technologies to solve the same problem â the mitigation of key GNSS errors in order to enable high precision GNSS:

- **1.** OSR services provide GNSS observations from the nearest reference station, or virtual reference station (VRS) to the rover. A communication link from reference station or VRS service provider to the rover is needed. The data is dependent on the position of the rover.
- **2.** SSR services rely on GNSS reference station network to model key errors (such as satellite or atmospheric errors) over large geographical regions and provide corrections to the rover via broadcast link such as internet or satellite L-band. All receivers receive the same data over a large area.

In this document, the following terminology is used: RTK refers to OSR-based solution (using RTCM corrections) while PPP-RTK refers to SSR-based solution (using SPARTN or CLAS corrections).

PPP-RTK technology is supported from firmware version HPS 1.21 onwards

## <span id="page-7-1"></span>**2.1.4 Real time kinematic**

u-blox ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver takes GNSS precision to the next level:

- Delivers accuracy down to the centimeter level: 0.01 m + 1 ppm CEP
- Fast time to first fix and robust performance with multi-band, multi-constellation reception
- Compatible with leading correction services for global coverage and versatility





# <span id="page-8-0"></span>**2.2 Architecture**

The ZED-F9R receiver provides all the necessary RF and baseband processing to enable multi-band, multi-constellation operation. The block diagram below shows the key functionality.

# <span id="page-9-0"></span>**3 Receiver functionality**

This chapter describes the ZED-F9R operational features and their configuration.

# <span id="page-9-1"></span>**3.1 Receiver configuration**

ZED-F9R is fully configurable with UBX configuration interface keys. The configuration database in the receiver's RAM holds the current configuration, which is used by the receiver at run-time. It is constructed on startup of the receiver from several sources of configuration. The configuration interface and the available keys are described fully in the applicable Interface description [[2](#page-125-1)].

A configuration setting stored in RAM remains effective until power-down or reset. If stored in BBR (battery-backed RAM), the setting will be used as long as the backup battery supply remains. Configuration settings can be saved permanently in flash memory.

**CAUTION** The configuration interface has changed from earlier u-blox positioning receivers. Legacy messages have been deprecated and are not supported as of firmware version HPS 1.30. Users are advised to adopt the configuration interface described in this document. See legacy UBX-CFG message fields reference section in the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

Configuration interface settings are held in a database consisting of separate configuration items. An item is made up of a pair consisting of a key ID and a value. Related items are grouped together and identified under a common group name: CFG-GROUP-\*; a convention used in u-center and within this document. Within u-center, a configuration group is identified as "Group name" and the configuration item is identified as the "item name" under the "Generation 9 Configuration View" - "Advanced Configuration" view.

The UBX messages available to change or poll the configurations are UBX-CFG-VALSET, UBX-CFG-VALGET, and UBX-CFG-VALDEL. For more information about these messages and the configuration keys, see the configuration interface section in the applicable Interface description [[2\]](#page-125-1).

## <span id="page-9-2"></span>**3.1.1 Changing the receiver configuration**

The configuration messages UBX-CFG-VALSET, UBX-CFG-VALGET and UBX-CFG-VALDEL will result in a UBX-ACK-ACK or a UBX-ACK-NAK response.

## <span id="page-9-3"></span>**3.1.2 Default GNSS configuration**

The ZED-F9R default GNSS configuration is set as follows:

- GPS: L1C/A, L2C
- GLONASS: L1OF, L2OF
- Galileo: E1B/C, E5b
- BeiDou: B1I, B2I
- QZSS: L1C/A, L2C

For more information about the default configuration, see the applicable Interface description [\[2](#page-125-1)].

#### **Table 1: Default interface settings**

UART2 can be configured as an RTCM interface. RTCM 3.4 is the default input protocol. UART2 may also be configured for NMEA output. NMEA GGA output is typically used with virtual reference service correction services.

- By default, ZED-F9R outputs NMEA messages that include satellite data for all GNSS bands being received. This results in a high NMEA output load for each navigation period. Make sure the UART baud rate used is sufficient for the selected navigation rate and the number of GNSS signals being received.
- Do not use UART2 as the only one interface to the host. Not all UBX functionality is available on UART2, such as firmware upgrade, safeboot or backup modes functionalities. No start-up boot screen is sent out from UART2.

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>**3.1.4 Basic receiver configuration**

This section summarizes the basic receiver configuration most commonly used.

## <span id="page-10-1"></span>**3.1.4.1 Communication interface configuration**

Several configuration groups allow operation mode configuration of the various communication interfaces. These include parameters for the data framing, transfer rate and enabled input/output protocols. See [Communication](#page-56-1) interfaces section for details. The configuration groups available for each interface are:

| Interface | Configuration groups                               |

**Table 2: Interface configurations**

## **3.1.4.2 Message output configuration**

This product supports two protocols for output messages. One is NMEA and the other one is a ublox proprietary "UBX" protocol. NMEA is a well-known industry standard, used mainly for providing information about position, time and satellites. UBX messages can be used to configure the receiver and also to periodically provide information about position, time and satellites. With the UBX protocol it is easy to monitor the receiver status and get much deeper information about the receiver status. The rate of NMEA and UBX protocol output messages are configurable and it is possible to enable or disable single NMEA or UBX messages individually.

If the rate configuration value is zero, then the corresponding message will not be output. Values greater than zero indicate how often the message is output.

For periodic output messages the rate relates to the event the message is related to. For example, the UBX-NAV-PVT (navigation, position, velocity and time solution) is related to the navigation epoch. If the rate of this message is set to one (1), it will be output for every navigation epoch. If the rate is set to two (2), it will be output every other navigation epoch.The rates of the output messages are individually configurable per communication interface. See the CFG-MSGOUT-\* configuration group.

Some messages, such as UBX-MON-VER, are non-periodic and will only be output as an answer to a poll request.

The UBX-INF-\* and NMEA-Standard-TXT information messages are non-periodic output messages that do not have a message rate configuration. Instead they can be enabled for each communication interface via the CFG-INFMSG-\* configuration group.

All message output is additionally subject to the protocol configuration of the communication interfaces.Messages of a givenprotocolwillnot be output until the protocol is enabled for output on the interface (see [Communication](#page-10-1) interface configuration).

## **3.1.4.3 GNSS signal configuration**

The GNSS constellations and signals are selected using keys from the CFG-SIGNAL-\*. configuration group. Each GNSS constellation can be enabled or disabled independently except for QZSS [1](#page-11-0) and SBAS [2](#page-11-1) . A GNSS constellation is considered to be enabled when the constellation enable key is set and at least one of the constellation's signal keys is enabled.

The following table shows possible configuration key combinations for the GPS constellation.

**Table 3: Example of possible values of configuration items for the GPS constellation**

The GPS constellation can be disabled if the SBAS and QZSS system are also disabled at the same time.

## **3.1.4.4 NMEA high precision mode**

ZED-F9R supports NMEA high precision mode.This mode increases the number of significant digits of the position output; latitude and longitude will have seven digits after the decimal point, and altitude will have three digits after the decimal point. By default it is not enabled since it violates the NMEA standard. NMEA high precision mode cannot be used while in NMEA compatibility mode or when NMEA output is limited to 82 characters. See configuration item CFG-NMEA-HIGHPREC in the applicable Interface description [[2](#page-125-1)] for more details.

NMEA high precision mode is disabled by default meaning that the default NMEA output will be insufficient to report a high precision position.

## <span id="page-12-0"></span>**3.1.5 RTCM corrections**

RTCM is a standard-based binary protocol for the communication of GNSS correction information. The ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver supports RTCM as specified by RTCM 10403.4, Differential GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) Services â Version 4 (December 1, 2023).

The RTCM specification is currently at version 3.4 and RTCM version 2 messages are not supported by this standard.

To modify the RTCM input settings, see the configuration section in the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

Users need to be aware of the datum used by the correction source. The receiver position will provide coordinates in the correction source reference frame.Thismay need to be taken into account when using the RTK-derived position. See the [Reference](#page-119-0) frames section in the Appendix for more information.

**Table 4: ZED-F9R supported input RTCM version 3.4 messages**

#### **3.1.5.2 NTRIP - networked transport of RTCM via internet protocol**

Networked Transport of RTCM via internet protocol, or NTRIP, is an open standard protocol for streaming differential data and other kinds of GNSS streaming data over the internet in accordance with specifications published by RTCM.

The NTRIP protocol is also used by SSR correction service providers to stream SSR correction data over the internet (e.g. SPARTN corrections).

There are three major parts to the NTRIP system: The NTRIP client, the NTRIP server, and the NTRIP caster:

- **1.** The NTRIP server is a PC or an on-board computer running NTRIP server software communicating directly with a GNSS reference station. The NTRIP server serves as the intermediary between the GNSS receiver (NTRIP Source) streaming correction data and the NTRIP caster.
- **2.** The NTRIP caster is an HTTP server which receives streaming correction data from one or more NTRIP servers and in turn streams the correction data to one or more NTRIP clients via the internet.
- **3.** The NTRIP client receives streaming correction data from the NTRIP caster to apply as realtime corrections to a GNSS receiver.

u-center GNSS [evaluation](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center) software provides an NTRIP client application that can help to evaluate a ZED-F9R design. The u-center NTRIP client connects over the internet to an NTRIP service provider, using access credentials such as user name and password from the service provider. The u-center NTRIP client then forwards the RTCM corrections to a ZED-F9R receiver connected to the local ucenter application. RTCM corrections from a virtual reference service are also supported by the ucenter NTRIP client.

## <span id="page-13-0"></span>**3.1.6 SPARTN corrections**

ZED-F9R can receive SPARTN corrections:

â¢ via the internet from a service provider



â¢ via UART directly connected to u-blox NEO-D9S that receives L-band satellite data.

For more information, see Multiple [SPARTN](#page-14-0) sources

- The PointPerfect service offers SPARTN support
- If you choose PointPerfect service, contact your local u-blox technical support

## **3.1.6.1 SPARTN protocol**

SPARTN is a binary protocol for the communication of SSR correction information.

ZED-F9R supports SPARTN as specified by SPARTN Interface Control Document â Version 2.0.2 (February, 2022).

To modify the SPARTN input/output settings, see the configuration section in the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

Users should be aware of the datum used by the correction source.

**Table 5: Supported input SPARTN version 2.0.2 messages**

The SPARTN protocol version 2.0.2 is supported as of firmware version HPS 1.40, where:

- Only the messages in [Table](#page-14-1) 5 are supported.
- Group and embedded authentication messages are not supported.
- SM1 messages must contain tropospheric model for the receiver to reach an RTK fixed solution.

Application designs using ZED-F9R and SPARTN correction streams should provide firmware upgrade capability; upcoming firmware versions will implement further SPARTN messages and functionalities.

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>**3.1.7 Multiple SPARTN sources**

ZED-F9R supports multipleSPARTN correction stream sources. It can support aSPARTN correction stream received over the internet (SPARTN message formatted IP stream) or over L-band satellites (SPARTN L-band stream formatted as UBX-RXM-PMP messages).

Only one source can be configured to be used at a time by ZED-F9R. The configuration item CFG-SPARTN-USE\_SOURCE can be configured to select which source will be used. Alternatively, the input protocol configuration items of a physical port can be configured to block input support for



the UBX or the SPARTN protocols on the desired ports, for example CFG-UART1INPROT-UBX, CFG-USBINPROT-SPARTN, etc.

| Source                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | CFG-SPARTN<br>USE_SOURCE |

| SPARTN IP stream        | This refers to corrections received in a SPARTN message format by any<br>interface of the ZED-F9R. The SPARTN corrections must follow the<br>SPARTN protocol specification and the source can be any SPARTN service<br>provider.                                      | IP (default)             |
| SPARTN L-band<br>stream | This refers to corrections received in a UBX-RXM-PMP message format by<br>any interface of the ZED-F9R. UBX-RXM-PMP messages are provided by u<br>blox L-band NEO-D9S receivers and contain frames of SPARTN messages<br>following the SPARTN protocol specification. | LBAND                    |

**Table 6: ZED-F9R supported SPARTN correction stream sources**

- In case a host application receives a SPARTN L-band stream through other means and converts UBX-RXM-PMP messages to SPARTN messages, then ZED-F9R treats these corrections as a SPARTN IP stream
- When providing a SPARTN L-band stream formatted as UBX-RXM-PMP messages, it is recommended to enable both UBX and SPARTN input protocol support on the port where the UBX-RXM-PMP is received. For example, as the default configuration on UART2, where CFG-UART2INPROT-UBX = 1 (true) and CFG-UART2INPROT-SPARTN = 1 (true).

The host application is responsible for deciding which stream to use. This can be based, for example, on the current IP or L-band reception conditions, the needs of the host application, power/cost considerations etc. The ZED-F9R does not provide any intelligent or automatic stream selection.

ZED-F9R provides additional monitoring information in the form of UBX-RXM-COR messages to help identify what is the current stream status in order to assist the host application in deciding which stream to use. UBX-RXM-COR reports, among other information:

- What is the type/subtype of the received SPARTN messages.
- Which is the source of the received SPARTN message (IP or L-band) and if it is used by ZED-F9R.
- What is the signal status in case of L-band streams.

Additionally some SPARTN input status information is also available in other UBX messages, such as UBX-MON-COMMS. For the full message specification, see ZED-F9R Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

If the selected SPARTN source contains encrypted SPARTN corrections, then extra monitoring information are reported through UBX-RXM-COR, such as if the message is encrypted and if it got decrypted.

## <span id="page-15-0"></span>**3.1.8 Encrypted SPARTN support**

SPARTN messages may be encrypted as indicated by SPARTN field TF004 (Encryption and authentication flag). ZED-F9R supports both encrypted and unencrypted SPARTN messages. Unencrypted SPARTN messages can be utilized as is by ZED-F9R without any special setup. Encrypted SPARTN messages can be decrypted and utilized by ZED-F9R once the appropriate dynamic keys are set and managed by the host application.

- The rest of this section describes the steps needed to enable encrypted SPARTN support for the u-blox PointPerfect service only
- Different dynamic keys apply for IP-only stream or IP+L-band stream. The type of service available to a user is specified by u-blox Terms and Services.

QZSS CLAS (centimeter-level augmentation service) is the satellite-based Japan's nationwide open service providing centimeter positioning accuracy. Corrections are transmitted on the QZSS L6 signal and encoded with Compact SSR (cSSR) protocol. Currently, the CLAS service provides corrections for GPS, Galileo, and QZSS satellites in view.

ZED-F9R supports CLAS corrections directly provided from NEO-D9C output in the form of UBX-RXM-QZSSL6. ZED-F9R can be directly connected to a NEO-D9C or the host application can forward the UBX-RXM-QZSSL6 message from NEO-D9C to ZED-F9R with no parsing needed.



For more information see the NEO-D9C integration manual and applicable interface description.

## <span id="page-17-0"></span>**3.1.10 Navigation configuration**

This section presents various configuration options related to the navigation engine. These options can be configured through CFG-NAVSPG-\* configuration keys.

## **3.1.10.1 Platform settings**

u-blox receivers support different dynamic platform models (see the table below) to adjust the navigation engine to the expected application environment. These platform settings can be changed dynamically without performing a power cycle or reset. The settings improve the receiver's interpretation of the measurements and thus provide a more accurate position output. Setting the receiver to an unsuitable platform model for the given application environment is likely to result in a loss of receiver performance and position accuracy.

The dynamic platform model can be configured through the CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL configuration item. The supported dynamic platform models and their details can be seen in [Table](#page-17-1) [8](#page-17-1) and [Table](#page-17-2) 9 below.

**Table 9: Dynamic platform model details**

- Robotic lawnmower (RLM) ande-scooterdynamicsmodels are supportedfromfirmware version HPS 1.21 onwards
- Rail dynamic model is supported from firmware version HPS 1.40 onwards
  - ZED-F9R's high precision sensor fusion algorithm is optimized for automotive, e-scooter, rail vehicle and robotic lawn mower platforms only

Applying dynamic platform models designed for high acceleration systems (e.g. airborne <2g) can result in a higher standard deviation in the reported position.

If a sanity check against a limit of the dynamic platform model fails, then the position solution is invalidated. [Table](#page-17-2) 9 above shows the types of sanity checks which are applied for a particular dynamic platform model.

#### **3.1.10.2 Navigation input filters**

The navigation input filters in CFG-NAVSPG-\* configuration group provide the input data of the navigation engine.

| Configuration item                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CFG-NAVSPG-FIXMODE                                     | By default, the receiver calculates a 3D position fix if possible but reverts to 2D<br>position if necessary (auto 2D/3D). The receiver can be forced to only calculate 2D<br>(2D only) or 3D (3D only) positions.   |
| CFG-NAVSPG-CONSTR_ALT, CFG<br>NAVSPG-CONSTR_ALTVAR     | The fixed altitude is used if fixMode is set to 2D only. A variance greater than zero<br>must also be supplied.                                                                                                      |
| CFG-NAVSPG-INFIL_MINELEV                               | Minimum elevation of a satellite above the horizon in order to be used in the<br>navigation solution. Low elevation satellites may provide degraded accuracy, due to<br>the long signal path through the atmosphere. |
| CFG-NAVSPG-INFIL_NCNOTHRS,<br>CFG-NAVSPG-INFIL_CNOTHRS | A navigation solution will only be attempted if there are at least the given number of<br>SVs with signals at least as strong as the given threshold.                                                                |

#### **Table 10: Navigation input filter parameters**

If the receiver only has three satellites for calculating a position, the navigation algorithm uses a constant altitude to compensate for the missing fourth satellite. When a satellite is lost after a successful 3D fix (min four satellites available), the altitude is kept constant at the last known value. This is called a 2D fix.

u-blox receivers do not calculate any navigation solution with less than three satellites.

## **3.1.10.3 Navigation output filters**

The result of a navigation solution is initially classified by the fix type (as detailed in the fixType field of UBX-NAV-PVT message). This distinguishes between failures to obtain a fix at all ("No Fix") and cases where a fix has been achieved, which are further subdivided into specific types of fixes (e.g. 2D, 3D, dead reckoning).



Where a fix has been achieved, a check is made to determine whether the fix should be classified as valid or not. A fix is only valid if it passes the navigation output filters as defined in CFG-NAVSPG-OUTFIL. In particular, both PDOP and accuracy values must be below the respective limits.

Important: Users are recommended to check the gnssFixOK flag in the UBX-NAV-PVT or the NMEA valid flag. Fixes not marked valid should not be used.

UBX-NAV-STATUS message also reports whether a fix is valid in the gpsFixOK flag. This message has only been retained for backwards compatibility and users are recommended to use the UBX-NAV-PVT message.

Speed (3D) low-pass filter, course over ground low-pass filter, low-speed course over ground filter, static hold, and freezing the course over ground not supported with the current firmware.

## **3.1.10.3.1 Speed (3D) low-pass filter**

The CFG-ODO-OUTLPVEL configuration item offers the possibility to activate a speed (3D)low-pass filter. The output of the speed low-pass filter is published in the UBX-NAV-VELNED message (speed field). The filtering level can be set via the CFG-ODO-VELLPGAIN configuration item with values between 0 (heavy low-pass filtering) and 255 (weak low-pass filtering).

The internal filter gain is computed as a function of speed. Therefore, the level as defined in the CFG-ODO-VELLPGAIN configuration item defines the nominal filtering level for speeds below 5 m/s.

#### **3.1.10.3.2 Course over ground low-pass filter**

The CFG-ODO-OUTLPCOG configuration item offers the possibility to activate a course over ground low-pass filter when the speed is below 8 m/s. The output of the course over ground (also named heading of motion 2D) low-pass filter is published in the UBX-NAV-PVT message (headMot field), UBX-NAV-VELNED message (heading field), NMEA-RMC message (cog field) and NMEA-VTG message (cogt field).The filtering level can be set via the CFG-ODO-COGLPGAIN configuration item with values between 0 (heavy low-pass filtering) and 255 (weak low-pass filtering).

The filtering level as defined in the CFG-ODO-COGLPGAIN configuration item defines the filter gain for speeds below 8 m/s. If the speed is higher than 8 m/s, no course over ground low-pass filtering is performed.

## **3.1.10.3.3 Low-speed course over ground filter**

The CFG-ODO-USE\_COG activates a low-speed course over ground filter and the CFG-ODO-COGMAXSPEED, CFG-ODO-COGMAXPOSACC configuration items offer the possibility to configure this feature (also named heading of motion 2D). This filter derives the course over ground from position at very low speed. The output of the low-speed course over ground filter is published in the UBX-NAV-PVT message (headMot field), UBX-NAV-VELNED message (heading field), NMEA-RMC message (cog field) and NMEA-VTG message (cogt field). If the low-speed course over ground filter is not configured, then the course over ground is computed as described in section [#unique\\_64](#page-0-0).

## **3.1.10.4 Weak signal compensation**

In normal operating conditions, low signal strength (i.e. signal attenuation) indicates likely contamination by multi-path. The receiver trusts such signals less in order to preserve the quality of the position solution in poor signal environments. This feature can result in degraded performance in situations where the signals are attenuated for another reason, for example due to antenna placement. In this case, the weak signal compensation feature can be used to restore normal performance. There are three possible modes:

- Disabled: no weak signal compensation is performed
- Automatic: the receiver automatically estimates and compensates for the weak signal



â¢ Configured: the receiver compensates for the weak signal based on a configured value

These modes can be selected using CFG-NAVSPG-SIGATTCOMP. In the case of the "configured" mode, the user should input the maximum C/N0 observed in a clear-sky environment, excluding any outliers or unusually high values. The configured value can have a large impact on the receiver performance, so it should be chosen carefully.

## <span id="page-20-0"></span>**3.1.11 Odometer**

The odometer provides information on travelled ground distance (in meter) using position and velocity measurements from the combined GNSS/DR navigation solution. For each computed travelled distance since the last odometer reset, the odometer estimates a 1-sigma accuracy value. The total cumulative ground distance is maintained and saved in the BBR memory.

The odometer feature is disabled by default. See the CFG-ODO-\* section in the ZED-F9R Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

# <span id="page-20-1"></span>**3.2 High precision sensor fusion (HPS)**

## <span id="page-20-2"></span>**3.2.1 Introduction**

u-blox solutions for high precision sensor fusion (HPS) allow high-accuracy positioning in places with poor or no GNSS coverage. HPS is based on sensor fusion dead reckoning (SFDR) technology, which combines GNSS measurements with those from external sensors. The ZED-F9R computes a solution type called GAWT (gyroscope, accelerometers, wheel tick) by combining GNSS measurements with the outputs of a 3-axis accelerometer, a 3-axis gyroscope and wheel tick (sometimes called a speed tick) or speed measurements. The utilization of these sensors ensures a quick recovery of the navigation solution after short GNSS signal outage (going under a bridge, signaling panels, and so on).

The firmware automatically detects and continuously calibrates the sensors.

## <span id="page-20-3"></span>**3.2.2 HPS dynamic platform models**

ZED-F9R supports different dynamic platform models to adjust the high precision sensor fusion navigation engine to the expected application environment. These platform settings can be changed dynamically without performing a power cycle or reset. However, it requires a recalibration of the sensors (IMU + WT/speed measurements). The settings improve the receiver's interpretation of the measurements and thus provide a more accurate position output. Setting the receiver to an unsuitable platform model for the given application environment is likely to result in a loss of receiver performance and position accuracy.

The dynamic platform model can be configured through the CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL configuration item.

ZED-F9R's high precision sensor fusion algorithm is optimized for the following platforms:

- Automotive
- E-scooter
- Robotic lawn mower
- Rail vehicles

## **3.2.2.1 Rail dynamic model**

Supported as of firmware version HPS 1.40



The rail dynamic model is used for applications with dynamics equivalent to those of a rail, from trams to high-speed trains. The rail dynamic model shall be selected with the CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL = 13 configuration item.

It combines the GNSS signal with the data from gyroscope, accelerometer and wheel ticks (or speed measurements), more information can be found in the [Solution](#page-23-0) type section.

The rail dynamic model does not support degraded HPS mode and directionless ADR.

It is intented to use without corrections. However, providing RTCM corrections to ZED-F9R will result in better and improved accuracy.

The rail dynamic model only supports the [User-defined](#page-28-0) IMU-mount alignment. Therefore, it is configured with the CFG-SFIMU-AUTO\_MNTALG\_ENA = 0 configuration key.

The receiver starts calibrating the sensors once the speed is over 9 km/h (2,5 m/s). The INS filter is also allowed to initialize when the train/tram is moving backwards. This is possible as the user is required to provide odometer data with polarity in the CFG-SFODO-DIR\_PINPOL configuration key.

- The rail dynamic model works with all the odometer inputs mentioned in section [Odometer](#page-30-1) [interfaces.](#page-30-1)
- Automatic wheel tick polarity detection should not be used with all the odometer inputs. For wheel ticks / speed, the polarity detection is configured with the CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTODIRPINPOL = 1 configuration item.
- For the rail dynamic model, the position, velocity, heading, pitch, and roll are frozen when the vehicle is static. The static state is determined once the sensors have been calibrated and the wheel ticks are stationary.

## **3.2.2.2 RLM dynamic model**

Supported from firmware version HPS 1.21 onwards

The RLM dynamic model is used for applications with dynamics equivalent to those of a robotic lawn mower (RLM). A robotic lawn mower is a low-speed vehicle with two pulling non-steering wheels attached to the same axis and capable of turning at different rates. The RLM dynamic platform model can be applied to any low-speed vehicle (max 3 m/s) with these characteristics. The RLM dynamic model shall be selected by the configuration item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL = 11.

It combines the GNSS signal with the data from gyroscope, accelerometer and wheel ticks (or speed measurements), more information can be found in the [Solution](#page-23-0) type section. The RLM dynamic model does not support degraded HPS mode, and requires wheel ticks or speed data to maintain fusion mode.

To reach decimeter-level accuracy, the ZED-F9R requires RTCM stream at all times.

The RLM dynamic model only supports the [User-defined](#page-28-0) IMU-mount alignment.

The receiver starts calibrating the sensors, once the following conditions are met.

- Speed is over 0.15 m/s.
- Heading accuracy is under 30 deg.
- Heading rate is less than 5 deg./s.
- RTK mode is fixed.

The INS filter is also allowed to initialize when the lawn mower is moving backwards. This is possible since the customer is required to provide odometer data with polarity.



- The RLM dynamic model can work with all the odometer inputs mentioned under the [Odometer](#page-30-1) [interfaces](#page-30-1) section. However, it is recommended to provide wheel ticks with polarity from both rear wheels. While enabling the configuration item CFG-SFODO-COMBINE\_TICKS = 1 .
- It is also strongly recommended to configure the coarse wheel tick scaling factor by the configuration item CFG-SFODO-FACTOR.
- Automatic wheel tick polarity detection should not be used for all the odometer inputs (wheel ticks / speed). This is achieved by the configuration item CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTODIRPINPOL = 1.
- Unlike automotive dynamic model, position, velocity, and attitude are not frozen when the lawn mower is static.
- The positioning performance is not guaranteed in special maneuvers where the lawn mower is lifted, carried or flipped 180 degrees.

#### **3.2.2.3 E-scooter dynamic model**

Supported from firmware version HPS 1.21 onwards

The e-scooter dynamic model is used for applications with dynamics equivalent to those of an e-scooter. An e-scooter is a low-speed vehicle with one pulling non-steering rear wheel and one steering front wheel. The e-scooter dynamic model shall be selected by the configuration item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL = 12.

It combines the GNSS signal with the data from gyroscope, accelerometer and wheel ticks (or speed measurements), more information can be found in the [Solution](#page-23-0) type section. The e-scooter dynamic model supports degraded HPS mode with missing wheel tick data. More information can be found in the [degraded](#page-36-0) HPS mode section.

To reach centimeter-level accuracy, the ZED-F9R requires RTCM stream at all times.

The e-scooter dynamic model only supports the [User-defined](#page-28-0) IMU-mount alignment.

The e-scooter feature benefits from odometer measurements (wheel ticks or wheel speed) from either wheel. Ideally, the odometer data should come from the rear wheel if the IMU is in the deck and from the front wheel when the IMU is in the handlebar.

The receiver starts calibrating the sensors once the following conditions are met.

- Speed is over 2.5 m/s.
- Heading accuracy is under 6 deg.
- Roll rate is less than 20 deg./s.
- Pitch rate is less than 15 deg./s.
- Heading rate is less than 15 deg./s.
- The positioning performance may be degraded when the e-scooter is driving on uneven surfaces like cobblestone roads due to the increased noise of the IMU measurements.
- The positioning performance is not guaranteed in special maneuvers where the e-scooter is lifted and carried, flipped 180 degrees, or left lying on the ground and lifted up again.
- Unlike automotive dynamic model, position, velocity, and attitude are not frozen when the escooter is static.
- The e-scooter dynamic model is not optimized for parking garages or longer GNSS outages.
- Automaticwheel tick polarity detection should not be used.This is achieved by the configuration item CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTODIRPINPOL = 1



When the IMU is installed at the handlebar, the navigation performance is degraded for two reasons: Firstly, the sensor fusion navigation filter assumes that the IMU shall be mounted to a fixed orientation with respect to the vehicle compartment where the wheel speed is measured. This assumption is broken when the IMU is installed to the handlebar while getting the wheel speed data from the rear wheel. Secondly, the IMU measurements tend to be noisier in the handlebar.

#### **3.2.2.4 Automotive dynamic model**

The automotive dynamic model is used for applications with dynamics equivalent to those of a passenger car. The automotive dynamic model shall be selected by the configuration item CFG-NAVSPG-DYNMODEL = 04.

It combines the GNSS signal with the data from gyroscope, accelerometer and wheel ticks (or speed measurements). More information can be found in the [Solution](#page-23-0) type section. The automotive dynamic model supports Degraded HPS mode with missing wheel tick data and directionless odometer mode. More information can be found in the [Degraded](#page-36-0) HPS mode and [Directionless](#page-36-1) [odometer](#page-36-1) mode section.

To reach centimeter-level accuracy, the ZED-F9R requires RTCM stream at all times.

The automotive dynamic model supports both the Automatic [IMU-mount](#page-27-0) alignment and the [User](#page-28-0)[defined IMU-mount alignment](#page-28-0).

To obtain optimal position accuracy the automotive dynamic model supports lever arms. More information can be found in the Installation [configuration](#page-24-0) section.

For the automotive dynamic model, the position, velocity, heading, pitch and roll are frozen when the vehicle is static.The static state is determined once the sensors are calibrated and the wheel ticks are stationary.

## <span id="page-23-0"></span>**3.2.3 Solution type**

ZED-F9R produces a solution that combines GNSS signals with data from gyroscopes, accelerometers and wheel tick sensors to compute a fused navigation solution. The solution type is called GAWT, and it is described in the following sections.

To operate the ZED-F9R in GAWT mode with optimal performance, the following tasks need to be completed:

- It is essential that the [IMU-to-antenna](#page-26-0) lever arm (CFG-SFIMU-IMU2ANT keys) and the [IMU](#page-26-1)[to-VRP](#page-26-1) lever arm (CFG-SFODO-IMU2VRP keys) are accurately configured (centimeter level ideally).
- The IMU misalignment angles are also essential. It is recommended to enable automatic alignment with the CFG-SFIMU-AUTO\_MNTALG\_ENA key, if misalignment angles are unknown. The misalignment angles can also be configured manually with CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG keys. Configuring misalignment angles manually speeds up the calibration procedure.
- It is mandatory to perform an initial calibration drive after flashing software, a cold start, or changing sensor configuration keys (CFG-SFCORE-\*, CFG-SFIMU-\* or CFG-SFODO-\*). The calibration drive allows the software to detect and calibrate the sensors. See section Accelerated [Initialization](#page-37-0) and Calibration Procedure for additional information. Performance is likely to be sub-optimal if the calibration drive is not performed correctly.
- If the maximum counter value of a wheel tick sensor cannot be represented as a power of 2 value, it must be configured manually. See section [Odometer](#page-30-2) Types for additional information.



â¢ It is strongly recommended that RTCM stream is available during the initial calibration drive, so that the resulting calibration parameters can be estimated. more accurately.

## <span id="page-24-0"></span>**3.2.4 Installation configuration**

This section describes the configurations for positioning and orientation of the ZED-F9R inside the vehicle.

## **3.2.4.1 Reference frames**

This section describes the two reference frames used in ZED-F9R HPS implementation.

## **3.2.4.1.1 IMU frame**

The IMU frame corresponds to the IMU instrumental frame within which the accelerometers and gyroscopes are assumed to be orthogonally mounted. The IMU frame is defined as follows:

- The origin of the IMU-frame is defined as the origin of the accelerometer sensor.
- By convention, an IMU contains three orthogonally-mounted accelerometers and three orthogonally-mounted gyroscopes which have the same orientation.
- The x-axis corresponds to the x-axis accelerometer/gyroscope sensing axis;
- The y-axis corresponds to the y-axis accelerometer/gyroscope sensing axis;
- The z-axis corresponds to the z-axis accelerometer/gyroscope sensing axis.

## **3.2.4.1.2 Installation frame**

The installation frame is a right-handed 3D Cartesian frame rigidly connected with the vehicle, used to define the installation setup required for HPS navigation. The installation frame is defined as follows:

- The origin (O in [Figure](#page-26-2) 3) is the IMU reference point (IRP);
- The x-axis points towards the front of the vehicle;
- The y-axis points towards the left of the vehicle;
- The z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing up.

## **3.2.4.2 Reference points**

This section describes the four reference points used in ZED-F9R HPS implementation.

## **3.2.4.2.1 Vehicle reference point (VRP)**

The vehicle reference point (VRP) is defined as the center of the vehicle's rear axle. The VRP is the reference point at which the single tick or speed must be measured.

Use the CFG-SFODO-IMU2VRP configuration keys to configure the VRP. See the interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1) for more information.

#### **3.2.4.2.2 Antenna reference point (ARP)**

The antenna reference point (ARP) refers to the GNSS measurements i.e. antenna phase center.

ARP is the reference point of primary navigation NAV output until sensors are not initialized. ARP is always the reference point of the secondary navigation NAV2 output.

#### **3.2.4.2.3 IMU reference point (IRP)**

The IMU reference point (IRP) is defined as the center of the IMU chip within the module. The IRP is the reference point where the 3-dimensional movement is measured.

By default, the HPS navigation engine will calculate the navigation solution at the IRP.





**Figure 2: ZED-F9R IRP (measurements to center of the IMU chip within the module)**

Z-axis is pointing upwards from the top of the module.

## **3.2.4.2.4 Configurable reference point (CRP)**

You can configure the configurable reference point (CRP) so that the navigation engine will calculate the navigation solution at the configured CRP.

Use the CFG-SFCORE-IMU2CRP configuration keys to configure the CRP. See the interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1) for more information.

## **3.2.4.3 IMU and GNSS antenna placement**

It is important to correctly position the ZED-F9R and the GNSS antenna to achieve a consistent navigation solution. In particular:

â¢ The ZED-F9R module and the GNSS antenna can be placed in any position on the vehicle. However, to achieve optimal performance, the HPS solution must be correctly configured. See the [Solution](#page-23-0) type section for more information.

However, consider the following conditions to achieve a consistent navigation solution:

- Place the antenna in a favorable position such as the dashboard or windshield.
- Ensure that the mean C/N0 under good signal conditions is above 35 dBHz.
- Mount the module firmly and protect it against vibrations and shocks.
- Configure the receiver according to the instructions in the Installation [configuration](#page-24-0) section.
- In articulated vehicles (for example truck and trailer), place the receiver and the antenna on the front section of the vehicle.

Exposing the IMU to vibration (for example from the vehicle engine) can cause position drifts in the UDR mode. Therefore, ZED-F9R observes the IMU measurements and raises UBX-ESF-STATUS.noisyMeas flags when the IMU noise level is considerably high. **If noisy measurements are detected**, use the CFG-MOT-IMU\_FILT\_WINDOW configuration key to filter out the IMU noise. For the optimal performance, set the CFG-MOT-IMU\_FILT\_WINDOW value between 100 and 200.



## <span id="page-26-0"></span>**3.2.4.3.1 IMU-to-antenna lever arm**

The IMU-to-antenna lever arm is defined as the offset from the ZED-F9R IRP to the GNSS antenna center [4](#page-26-3) .

If the GNSS antenna is placed at a significant distance from the ZED-F9R module, errors can be introduced in the navigation solution (particularly when the vehicle experiences high heading rate). These errors can be compensated for by configuring the IMU-to-antenna lever arm offset in the installation frame.

Use the CFG-SFIMU-IMU2ANT configuration keys to configure the IMU-to-antenna lever arm components. See the interface description [[2](#page-125-1)] for more information.

<span id="page-26-2"></span>

**Figure 3: Lever arm configuration**

#### <span id="page-26-1"></span>**3.2.4.3.2 IMU-to-VRP lever arm**

The IMU-to-VRP lever arm is defined as the offset from the ZED-F9R IRP to the VRP in the installation frame.

If the ZED-F9R module is placed at a significant distance from the VRP, errors can be introduced in the navigation solution (particularly when the vehicle experiences high heading rate). These errors can be compensated for by configuring the IMU-to-VRP lever arm offset in the installation frame.

Use the CFG-SFODO-IMU2VRP configuration keys to configure the IMU-to-VRP lever arm components. See the interface description [[2](#page-125-1)] for more information.

<span id="page-26-3"></span><sup>4</sup> For best performance defining the antenna phase center is relevant, not the physical center of the antenna.



## **3.2.4.3.3 User-defined lever arm**

The lever arm keys CFG-SFCORE-IMU2CRP, CFG-SFODO-IMU2VRP and CFG-SFIMU-IMU2ANT must be interpreted in the following way:

- **LA\_X**: Corresponds to the x-axis component of the lever arm.
- **LA\_Y**: Corresponds to the y-axis component of the lever arm.
- **LA\_Z**: Corresponds to the z-axis component of the lever arm.
- To prevent degradation of the positioning solution, the lever arms must be configured with a resolution of at least 1 cm.
- Longer lever arms, which are likely with rail applications, may lead to inconsistent deviation in the published accuracies. Therefore, it is recommended to configure the CRP within a 2 m range.

## <span id="page-27-1"></span>**3.2.4.4 IMU-mount alignment**

This section describes how IMU-mount misalignment angles, that is, the angles which rotate the installation frame to the IMU-frame, can be configured.

The IMU-mount misalignment angles are defined as follows:

â¢ The transformation from the installation frame to the IMU frame is described by three Euler angles about the installation frame axes denoted as *IMU-mount roll*, *IMU-mount pitch* and *IMUmount yaw* angles. All three angles are referred to as the *IMU-mount misalignment angles*.

The default assumption is that the IMU-frame and the installation frame have the same orientation (that is, all axes are parallel). If the IMU-mount misalignment angles are slightly incorrect (typically a fewdegrees), thenavigationsolutioncanbedegraded. If there are large (tens ofdegrees)IMU-mount misalignments, the position calculation may fail. Therefore, it is essential to correctly configure the IMU-mount misalignment settings.

It is strongly recommended to use the automatic IMU-mount alignment as described in the following section.

## <span id="page-27-0"></span>**3.2.4.4.1 Automatic IMU-mount alignment**

The automatic IMU-mount alignment engine automatically estimates the IMU-mount roll, pitch and yaw angles. It requires an initialization phase during which no INS/GNSS fusion can be achieved (see the Fusion filter [modes](#page-34-2) section for further details). The progress of the automatic alignment initialization can be monitored with the UBX-ESF-STATUS message, and/or with the UBX-ESF-ALG message providing more details. When the vehicle is subject to sufficient dynamics (i.e. left and right turns during a normal drive), the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine will estimate the IMU-mount misalignment angles. Once the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine has sufficient confidence in the estimated angles, the IMU-mount misalignment angles initialization phase is completed. The raw accelerometer and gyroscope data (that is, the IMU observations) are then compensated for IMU-mount misalignment and sensor fusion can begin. The resulting IMU-mount misalignment angles are output in the UBX-ESF-ALG message.

## **Enabling/disabling automatic IMU-mount alignment**

The user can activate/deactivate the automatic IMU-mount alignment with the CFG-SFIMU-AUTO\_MNTALG\_ENA configuration key.

If automatic IMU-mount alignment is deactivated while aligning, the estimated misalignment angles that were available at deactivation time are used (only if they were initialized, see the next section). If automatic IMU-mount alignment is reactivated, alignment is pursued by starting from the state where deactivation happened.



## <span id="page-28-0"></span>**3.2.4.4.2 User-defined IMU-mount alignment**

It is possible to configure the IMU-mount misalignment angles using the CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG configuration keys. The values that should be set in the configuration message are the Euler angles required to rotate the installation frame to the IMU-frame. The IMU-mount yaw rotation should be performedfirst, then the IMU-mount pitch andfinally the IMU-mount roll. At each stage, the rotation is around the appropriate axis of the transformed installation frame, meaning that the order of the rotation sequence is important (see the figure below).



#### **Figure 4: Euler angles**

If there is only a single IMU-mount misalignment angle, it may be measured as shown in the three examples below.





#### **Figure 5: Installation frame**

In order to prevent significant degradation of the positioning solution the IMU-mount misalignment angles should be configured with an accuracy of less than 5 degrees.

The following list describes in detail how the CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG keys are to be interpreted with respect to the example illustrated in the figure above:

- **CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG\_YAW**: The IMU-mount yaw angle (yaw) corresponds to the rotation around the installation frame z-axis (vertical) required for aligning the installation frame to the IMU frame (yaw = 344.0 degrees if the IMU-mount misalignment is composed of a single rotation around the installation frame z-axis, that is,with no IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount pitch rotation).
- **CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG\_PITCH**: The IMU-mount pitch angle (pitch) corresponds to the rotation around the installation frame y-axis required for aligning the installation frame to the IMU-frame (pitch = 26.5 degrees if the IMU-mount alignment is composed of a single rotation around the installation frame y-axis, that is,with no IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount yawrotation).
- **CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG\_ROLL**: The IMU-mount roll angle (roll) corresponds to the rotation around the installation frame x-axis required for aligning the installation frame to the IMU frame (roll = -23.5 degrees if the IMU-mount misalignment is composed of a single rotation around installation frame x-axis, that is, with no IMU-mount pitch and IMU-mount yaw rotation).



â¢ **CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG\_TOLERANCE**: The IMU-mount angle tolerence corresponds to the tolerance level to configure the IMU-mount alignment angles (CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG\_PITCH, ROLL, YAW). By default, the tolerance level is set to LOW (value 0), meaning that the specified alignment angles are known with high accuracy, i.e. up to 2 degrees wrong. If needed, users can select the tolerance level HIGH (value 1), meaning that the configured angles must be considered coarse, for example because not professionally measured, and they can include errors preferably within 5 degrees, and in any case no more than 10 degrees. Alternatively, if angles cannot be set with such accuracies, users can enable the automatic IMU-mount alignment (CFG-SFIMU-AUTO\_MNTALG\_ENA), or at least enable it in a first run in order to measure the angles, when applicable for the dynamic model. This configuration helps in the customization of the specific setup. A low tolerance level profits from shorter SF calibration times. A higher tolerance level increases calibration times but also increases robustness in case there are alignment deviations from nominal values.

## <span id="page-30-0"></span>**3.2.5 Sensor configuration**

This section describes the external sensor configuration parameters.

## <span id="page-30-2"></span>**3.2.5.1 Odometer configuration**

Odometer is a generic term for wheel tick or speed sensor.

You can configure the odometer with the CFG-SFODO-\* configuration keys.

ZED-F9R has been designed to work with odometer input. Although the ZED-F9R calculates a position without odometer input (Degraded HPS mode), the accuracy of the position is compromised.

## <span id="page-30-1"></span>**3.2.5.1.1 Odometer interfaces**

Odometer data can be delivered to ZED-F9R via the following interfaces:

**Hardware interface**: ZED-F9R has a dedicated pin (WT) for analog wheel tick signal input, and another pin (DIR) dedicated to wheel tick direction signal.

- The WT pin is enabled with the CFG-SFODO-USE\_WT\_PIN key.
- The DIR pin polarity is automatically detected by the receiver by default. To manually configure the polarity, you must turn off automatic detection by setting the CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTODIRPINPOL key and you must define the polarity in the CFG-SFODO-DIR\_PINPOL key.
- Double-edge counting can be enabled via the CFG-SFODO-CNT\_BOTH\_EDGES key. It can increase performance with low-resolution wheel ticks, but is not suitable for all types of wheel tick signals. It **must not** be used with signals that are not generated with approximately 50% duty signal as it would impair performance.

**Software interface**: Odometer data can be delivered to the receiver over one of the communication interfaces. The data shall be contained in UBX-ESF-MEAS messages. UBX-ESF-MEAS (data type 10) shall be used for single-tick odometer data and UBX-ESF-MEAS (data type 11) shall be used for speed odometer data. See the interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1) for more information.

- By default, the receiver automatically ignores the WT pin if wheel tick/speed data are detected on the software interface. Therefore data coming from the software interface will be prioritized over data coming from the hardware interface. To disable the automatic use of data detected on the software interface, set the CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTOSW key.
- While providing the speed data over software interface, the CFG-SFODO-COMBINE\_TICKS should remain disabled.



## **3.2.5.1.2 Odometer types**

ZED-F9R supports sensors delivering the following types of data:

- **Relative wheel tick data**: If the wheel tick sensor delivers relative wheel tick counts (that is, wheel tick count since the previous measurement), the CFG-SFODO-COUNT\_MAX value must be set to 0.
- **Absolute wheel tick data**: If the wheel tick sensor delivers absolute wheel tick counts (that is, wheel tick count since startup at time tag 0) that always increase, regardless of driving forward or backward (with driving direction indicated separately). If the counter is configured to 1, the maximum absolute wheel tick counter value is automatically estimated by the receiver for a maximum counter value that can be represented as a 2^N value. Other maximum counter values must be manually configured. For example, a CFG-SFODO-COUNT\_MAX=1024 roll-over value would be automatically estimated, but a CFG-SFODO-COUNT\_MAX=1000 must be configured. The maximum counter value is configured by setting the CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTOCOUNTMAX key and setting the CFG-SFODO-COUNT\_MAX value to the upper threshold of the absolute wheel tick sensor count before starting again from zero (roll-over).
- **Speed data**: Data coming from this sensor type can only be delivered to the receiver via one of the communication ports within a UBX-ESF-MEAS (data type 11). The speed data shall be delivered in meters per second.

If speed data but no absolute or relative wheel tick data are detected, the receiver automatically uses the speed data without the need for reconfiguring the CFG-SFODO-USE\_SPEED key. This behavior can be deactivated by setting the CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTOSPEED key and by manually setting or clearing the CFG-SFODO-USE\_SPEED key. If wheel tick data (or both wheel tick and speed data) are detected on the software interface, the receiver uses the data type (by default wheel tick data) corresponding to the configured CFG-SFODO-USE\_SPEED key.

Tomake the receiver interpret incomingspeeddata (data type11inESF-MEAS)insteadof the single wheel tick data (data type 10 in ESF-MEAS) on the software interface, the CFG-SFODO-USE\_SPEED key must be set.

It is strongly recommended to use the absolute wheel tick sensors to ensure robust measurement processing even after sensor failures or outages.

## **3.2.5.1.3 Odometer settings**

You can configure the following odometer settings:

- **Sampling frequency**: The wheel tick/speed data sampling frequency (CFG-SFODO-FREQUENCY) should be provided with an accuracy of approximately 10 %. If not provided, it is automatically determined during the initialization phase: this requires a consistent data rate and can take several minutes. Once initialized, the sampling frequency will be stored in a non-volatile storage. For optimal navigation performance, the standard wheel tick/speed input at 10 Hz is recommended.
- **Latency**: For best positioning performance, the latency of the wheel tick/speed data (CFG-SFODO-LATENCY) should be given as accurately as possible (to within at least 10 ms). If not provided, the wheel tick/speed data latency is assumed zero. More details about latency can be found in the Sensor Time [Tagging](#page-32-0) section.
- **Quantization error**: If absolute/relative wheel tick data are used (for example, if the tick data is a distance), the quantization error can be defined in the CFG-SFODO-QUANT\_ERROR key. The quantization error can be calculated as 2\*Pi\*R / T with R the wheel radius, T the number of ticks per wheel rotation. If the quantization error is not provided, it is automatically initialized by the receiver.



- **Speed data accuracy (software interface only)**: If speed data are used, the speed data accuracy can be set in the CFG-SFODO-QUANT\_ERROR key. If not provided, the speed data accuracy is automatically initialized by the receiver.
- **Sensor dead band**: Some wheel tick or speed sensors have a dead band which is the value below which no speed is reported. If this is the case, the value needs to be configured in the CFG-SFODO-SPEED\_BAND key. However, the performance will still be degraded compared to having no dead band. If not provided, the receiver assumes the sensor has no dead band.
- **Scale factor**: If the coarse WT scale factor is not configured in the CFG-SFODO-FACTOR key, it is estimated automatically during the initialization (see section [Initialization](#page-34-2) mode for more details).
- **Combination of multiple rear wheel ticks (software interface only)**: If wheel ticks are being received from both rear wheels, the receiver can be configured with the CFG-SFODO-COMBINE\_TICKS key to use the combined rear wheel ticks rather than a single tick. It is recommended to use combined rear wheel ticks if available, as they are often of higher quality than the single ticks.

## <span id="page-32-0"></span>**3.2.5.2 UBX-ESF-MEAS time tagging (software interface only)**

To achieve optimal performance with the fusion solution it is essential to determine the epoch in the receiver time frame when the UBX-ESF-MEAS sensor data were taken. This may be done in either of the following ways:

- First byte reception: reception time of the first byte of the UBX-ESF-MEAS message
- Time mark on external input: reception time of time mark signal sent to external input

The latency of sensor data is the absolute difference between the time at which the sensor measurement is taken and the time at which either the first byte of the UBX-ESF-MEAS message or the pre-processor's time mark are detected at the receiver.

The latency for the wheel tick can be set with CFG-SFODO-LATENCY key, for accelerometer with CFG-SFIMU-ACCEL\_LATENCY and for Gyroscope with CFG-SFIMU-GYRO\_LATENCY key.

It is essential that the time tags used for all UBX-ESF-MEAS data have the same resolution.

ZED-F9R automatically generates UBX-ESF-MEAS messages containing measurements from the internal IMU using the default time tag resolution of 1 millisecond. If the customer wants to input odometer data with UBX-ESF-MEAS messages, it is essential that the odometer time tag has a resolution of 1 millisecond.

## **3.2.5.2.1 First byte reception**

The easiest way to determine the sensor measurement generation time is to have the GNSSreceiver assume the time of reception of the first byte of the UBX-ESF-MEAS message (minus the constant configured latency in CFG-SFODO-LATENCY) to be the time of sensor measurement. This approach is the simplest to implement, but time mark on external input can yield better latency control and compensation.





**Figure 6: First byte reception**

## **3.2.5.2.2 Time mark on external input**

In this case, the preprocessor unit generating the measurements sends a signal to the EXTINT input of the GNSS receiver, marking the moment of the measurement generation. The subsequent UBX-ESF-MEAS message is then flagged accordingly, and the measurements in the message are assumed to have been generated at the time of external signal reception (minus the constant configured latency in CFG-SFODO-LATENCY). This approach is the preferred solution, but it can be difficult to realize an exact analog time signal for the preprocessor unit.



**Figure 7: Time mark on external input**

## **3.2.5.2.3 UBX-ESF-MEAS time tagging configuration**

The time tag factor can be used to convert the sensor time tags into the required seconds.

It is essential that the time tags used for all UBX-ESF-MEAS data have the same resolution.

ZED-F9R automatically generates UBX-ESF-MEAS messages containing measurements from the internal IMU using the default time tag resolution of 1 millisecond. If the customer wants to input odometer data with UBX-ESF-MEAS messages, it is essential that the odometer time tag has a resolution of 1 millisecond.

ZED-F9R automatically generates UBX-ESF-MEAS messages containing measurements from the internal IMU. If the customer inputs UBX-ESF-MEAS with odometer data with a different sensor time tag factor than the one used by ZED-F9R for IMU data, it will fail!

The same sensor time tag (ttag) factor must be used for all UBX-ESF-MEAS data.

The following sensor time tagging settings need to be specified:

â¢ **CFG-SFCORE-SEN\_TTAG\_FACT:** This parameter can be used to convert the sensor time tags from their original time unit into the required seconds. It has a resolution of 1 microsecond. The default value is 1000 (1 millisecond).

â¢ **CFG-SFCORE-SEN\_TTAG\_MAX:** External sensor time tags can be encoded in different data types (signed/unsigned, varying number of bytes) which might vary across sensor types. For example, if the IMU raw packet's time tag field is encoded into an unsigned long integer (4 bytes), the maximum possible time tag value is 4294967295 (0xFFFFFFFFin hexadecimal).

## <span id="page-34-0"></span>**3.2.6 HPS system configuration**

#### **3.2.6.1 Enabling/disabling fusion filter**

The HPS feature can be enabled and disabled with the CFG-SFCORE-USE\_SF key. If HPS is disabled, the receiver outputs a GNSS-only solution. IMU sensor measurements are still available in UBX-ESF-MEAS and UBX-ESF-RAW messages.

#### **3.2.6.2 Recommended configuration**

In general, it is recommended to use the default configuration values in order to achieve optimal HPS navigation performance.

By default, the navigation solution update rate is 1 Hz. It can be configured with the CFG-RATE-NAV key.

At higher navigation rates, it is strongly recommended to check (and maybe reduce) the number of enabled output messages. CPU load, memory and interface bandwidth constraints may be a limiting factor.

## <span id="page-34-1"></span>**3.2.7 Operation**

This section describes how the HPS receiver operates.

#### <span id="page-34-2"></span>**3.2.7.1 Fusion filter modes**

The fusion filter operates in different modes which are output in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message.

The table below summarizes the different fusion filter modes with the receiver's associated tasks.

| Mode             | Performed tasks / Possible causes                    | Published fix type |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|

#### **Table 11: Fusion modes**

More details about each fusion mode are given in the following sections.

#### **3.2.7.1.1 Initialization mode**

The purpose of the initialization phase is to estimate all unknown parameters which are required for achieving fusion. The initialization phase is triggered after a receiver cold start or a filter reset in case of fusion failure. The receiver is in initialization mode if the fusionMode field in the UBX-



ESF-STATUS message is 0:INITIALIZING. In this case the required sensor calibration status (calibStatus) is flagged as 0: NOT CALIBRATED and the navigation solution output during initialization is based on GNSS solely.

The initialization phase comprises the following internal steps whose status is published in the initStatus field of the UBX-ESF-STATUS message:

- **IMU initialization:** Unknown crucial IMU parameters such as sensor sampling frequency are estimated during initialization. As long as all required IMU parameters are not initialized, the status of the IMU initialization (imuInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message. Moreover, the required sensor calibration statuses (calibStatus) are flagged as 0:NOT CALIBRATED in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message. Note that if the user configured all required sensor settings, this step is skipped and IMU initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED.
- **IMU-mount alignment initialization:** If automatic IMU-mount alignment is enabled (see the Automatic [IMU-mount](#page-27-0) alignment section), initial IMU-mount roll, pitch and yaw angles need to be estimated. For that, good GNSS signal reception as well as sufficient vehicle dynamics (i.e. a series of left and right turns during a normal drive) need to be at hand. As long as the IMUmount alignment is not initialized, the status of the IMU-mount alignment (mntAlgStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message. Once initialized, the IMUmount alignment status is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED. If no IMU-mount alignment is required, the IMU-mount alignment is flagged as 0:OFF. A detailed description of the automatic IMUmount alignment operation can be found in the Automatic [IMU-mount](#page-38-0) alignment section.
- **INS initialization:** Before entering fusion mode, the initial vehicle position, velocity and especially attitude (vehicle roll, pitch and heading angles) need to be known with sufficient accuracy. This is achieved during INS initialization phase using GNSS which comprises an INS coarse alignment step. As long as the fusion filter is not initialized, the status of the INS initialization (insInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message. Once initialized, the INS initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED.
- **Wheel tick sensor initialization:** Solution enters fusion mode (fusionMode field in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message is on 1:FUSION), even when wheel tick is not yet initialized, following a degraded HPS mode approach described in [Degraded](#page-36-0) HPS mode section. WT sensor parameters, such as initial wheel tick factor, are estimated in parallel and are used once estimated with sufficient accuracy. As long as the wheel tick parameters are not initialized, the status of the wheel tick initialization (wtInitStatus) is flagged as 1:INITIALIZING in the UBX-ESF-STATUS message. Once initialized, the wheel tick sensor initialization is flagged as 2:INITIALIZED, WT data are used by the filter and the parameters are stored in non-volatile storage. If no wheel tick data are required, the wheel tick initialization is flagged as 0:OFF.
- **Sensor error (e.g. missing data) detected:** Sensor timeout of more than 500 ms will trigger an INS re-initialization.

Note that initialization phase requires good GNSS signal conditions as well as periods during which vehicle is stationary and moving (including left and right turns). Once all required initialization steps are achieved, fusion mode is triggered and continuous calibration begins.

## **3.2.7.1.2 Fusion mode**

Once initialization phase is achieved, the receiver enters fusion mode. The receiver is in fusion mode if the UBX-ESF-STATUS.fusionMode field is set to 1:FUSION. The fusion filter then starts to compute combined GNSS/dead reckoning fixes (fused solutions) and to calibrate the sensors required for computing the fused navigation solution. This is the case when the sensor calibration status (UBX-ESF-STATUS.calibStatus) is set to 1:CALIBRATING. As soon as the



calibration reaches a status where optimal fusion performance can be expected, (UBX-ESF-STATUS.calibStatus is set to 2/3:CALIBRATED.

#### <span id="page-36-0"></span>**3.2.7.1.3 Degraded HPS mode**

In case of WT sensor error / timeout (500 ms), or normal WT sensor initialization, or the WT sensor is not available, the solution falls back to degraded HPS mode. The UBX-ESF-STATUS.fusionMode field still shows 1:FUSION when the receiver enters degraded HPS mode. However, the following flags can be used to determine when the receiver has entered degraded HPS mode:

- The UBX-ESF-STATUS.wtInitStatus shows 1:INITIALIZING.
- The WT fault flag, UBX-ESF-STATUS.missingMeas field, is set to 1, indicating a WT timeout has been detected.

Degraded HPS mode is planned for shortWTsensor error / outages. If theWTsensor is not available, the customer should perform thorough testing of the degraded HPS mode.

In the Degraded HPS mode, the receiver does not lock the position while the vehicle is stationary, so the position could drift slightly, based on the GNSSconditions. The receiver needsWT for stationary phase detection.

#### <span id="page-36-1"></span>**3.2.7.1.4 Directionless odometer mode**

This feature allows the use of odometer data for which the sign bit or the wheel tick (WT) pin polarity input is not trusted or not available. The directionless odometer support can be enabled by the configuration item CFG-SFODO-DIS\_DIR\_INFO=1.

After setting this configuration item, the directional information, that is, the polarity bit of the WT measurement and the sign of the wheel speed measurement in the UBX-ESF-MEAS message as well as the WT polarity pin input will be ignored. In particular, the following configuration items shall have no effect when used in combination with CFG-SFODO-DIS\_DIR\_INFO=1.

- CFG-SFODO-DIR\_PINPOL
- CFG-SFODO-DIS\_AUTODIRPINPOL

The performance with directionless odometer feature is expected to be worse than that of ADR with usual directional odometer data, but better than that of the degraded HPS fallback mode.

The odometer measurements shall be used as a velocity measurement only if the direction of motion (forwards/backwards) can be reliably determined based on other measurements (GNSS, IMU). Typically, this requires high enough speed.

#### **3.2.7.1.5 Suspended fusion mode**

Sensor fusion is temporarily suspended in cases where no fused solution should/can be computed. In this case, the receiver produces a GNSS-only solution. The receiver is considered to be in temporarily disabled fusion mode when the UBX-ESF-STATUS.fusionMode field is set to 2:SUSPENDED.

Fusion is suspended in the following scenarios:

- If one or several sensors deliver erroneous data or no data at all. Fusion is suspended during the sensor failure period. The receiver automatically recovers once the affected sensor or sensors are back to normal operation.
- If the vehicle is detected to be on a ferry or other moving platform, where odometer data does not indicate any displacement.



## **3.2.7.1.6 Disabled fusion mode**

Sensor fusion can be permanently disabled if recurrent fusion failures occur. The receiver is considered to be in permanently disabled fusion mode if the UBX-ESF-STATUS.fusionMode field is set to 3:DISABLED. In this case, the receiver produces a GNSS-only solution if possible.

Fusion is permanently disabled in the following cases:

- If the fusion filter was manually turned off by the user with the CFG-SFCORE-USE\_SF key.
- If the filter diverges due to significantly wrong installation or filter parameters.

## <span id="page-37-0"></span>**3.2.7.2 Accelerated initialization and calibration procedure**

This section describes how to perform fast initialization and calibration of the HPS receiver for evaluation purposes.

The duration of the initialization phases depends on the quality of the GNSS signals and the dynamics encountered by the vehicle.

You can shorten the initialization time required to reach sensor fusion mode, while using the automotive dynamic model, by following the procedure in the order described in the table below.

| Phase                                         | Procedure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Indicator of success                                                                                                                                                |

**Table 12: Accelerated initialization procedure for automotive vehicles**

Once initialization is completed, the UBX-ESF-STATUS.fusionMode field shows 1:FUSION, combined GNSS/dead reckoning fixes (fused solutions) are output and the sensors used in the navigation filter start calibrating. Calibration is a continuous process running in the background, and it directly impacts the navigation solution quality.

You can shorten the calibration time required for reaching optimal HPS navigation performance by following the procedure described in the table below.

**Table 14: Accelerated initialization and calibration procedure for e-scooters**

Note that the calibration status (UBX-ESF-STATUS.calibStatus) of some used sensors might fall back to 1:CALIBRATING if the receiver is operated in challenging conditions. In such a case, fused navigation solution uncertainty increases until optimal conditions are observed again for recalibrating the sensors.

In the presence of significant temperature gradient affecting the gyroscopes, the fused navigation performance might also depend on how well the temperature compensation table is populated. The table is gradually filled in while the vehicle is stationary and by observing gyroscope biases at different temperatures. Therefore the quality of the gyroscope temperature compensation depends on how many temperature bins could be observed while the vehicle was stationary and on the duration of the observation for each bin.

#### <span id="page-38-0"></span>**3.2.7.3 Automatic IMU-mount alignment**

#### **3.2.7.3.1 Alignment solution output**

The IMU-mount misalignment angles are shown in UBX-ESF-ALG messages.

â¢ **IMU-mount angle initialization**: During IMU-mount angle initialization the (UBX-ESF-ALG.status field is equal to 2), and the published angles (yaw, pitch and roll)



correspond to the current estimated values but are not yet applied for rotating the IMU observations.

- **IMU-mount angle initialization complete**: After initialization the (UBX-ESF-ALG.status field is equal to or higher than 3), the published angles correspond to the estimated value and are applied for rotating the IMU observations.
- **Automatic IMU-mount alignment disabled**: If automatic IMU-mount alignment is disabled, the published angles correspond to the IMU-mount angles configured by the the user (see [User](#page-27-1)[defined IMU-mount Alignment](#page-27-1) section) and are applied for rotating the IMU observations.
- **CAUTION** If user-defined IMU-mount misalignment angles were configured by the user using CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG keys (see [User-defined](#page-28-0) IMU-mount alignment section) and automatic IMU-mount alignment is active, the angles output in the UBX-ESF-ALG message still correspond to the definition given above: they represent the full rotation required for transforming IMU data from installation frame to IMU frame. This means that the output misalignment angles are computed from the composed rotation of the user-defined rotation and the internally-estimated rotation.

#### **3.2.7.3.2 Alignment progress**

The progress of the automatic IMU-mount alignment can be monitored by checking the UBX-ESF-ALG.status field.

- **IMU-mount roll/pitch angle initialization ongoing**: The alignment engine is initializing the IMUmount roll and pitch angles (UBX-ESF-ALG.status is 1). Both angles can only be initialized if vehicle encounters left and right turns (as during a normal drive).
- **IMU-mount yaw angle initialization ongoing**: The alignment engine is initializing the IMUmount yaw angle (UBX-ESF-ALG.status is 2). IMU-mount yaw angle can only be initialized once IMU-mount roll and pitch angles are initialized and if vehicle encounters left and right turns (as during a normal drive).
- **IMU-mount alignment coarse calibration ongoing**: Once initialized (UBX-ESF-ALG.status is 3), the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine has sufficient confidence in all IMUmount misalignment angles and validates their use for compensating the accelerometer and gyroscope data (fused navigation solutions can be computed). The IMU-mount misalignment angles are filtered each time the observed vehicle dynamics are measurable.
- **IMU-mount alignment fine calibration ongoing**: Once the IMU-mount misalignment angles are estimated with a good accuracy, the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine becomes more conservative in updating the IMU-mount misalignment angles (UBX-ESF-ALG.status is 4).

## **3.2.7.3.3 Alignment reset**

If for some reasons the IMU-mount misalignment angles estimated by the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine are no longer valid (for example due to a change in the physical mounting of the device), the IMU-mount misalignment angles can be reset by sending a UBX-ESF-RESETALG message. In addition, the misalignment angles are also reset in the following cases:

- If a cold start command is sent.
- If the user-defined IMU-mount misalignment angles are changed by sending CFG-SFIMU-IMU\_MNTALG keys (see [User-defined](#page-28-0) IMU-mount alignment section for more details).

The IMU-mount alignment engine then falls back into initialization mode.

#### **3.2.7.3.4 Alignment errors**

The following errors might be output in the UBX-ESF-ALG.error bit field:

â¢ **IMU-mount roll/pitch angle error**: If the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount roll and/or IMU-mount pitch misalignment angles (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the UBX-ESF-ALG.error bit 0 is set to 1.



- **IMU-mount yaw angle error**: If the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine suspects wrong IMU-mount yaw misalignment angle (either due to a wrong initialization or a change in the physical mounting of the device), the UBX-ESF-ALG.error bit 1 is set to 1.
- **Euler angle singularity ('gimbal-lock') error**: The Euler angle singularity UBX-ESF-ALG.error bit 2 is set when the automatic IMU-mount alignment engine detects an installation where the IMU frame is misaligned in such a way that a degree of freedom is lost when two IMU-mount misalignment (Euler) angles begin to describe the same rotations (or axes). This happens, for example, with an IMU-mount misalignment of +/- 90 degrees around the IMU-mount pitch axis, where IMU-mount roll and IMU-mount yaw cannot be distinguished from each other. In such a case, these IMU-mount misalignment angles start to heavily fluctuate with time due to the mathematical singularity occurring at these points, meaning that the IMU-mount misalignment angles output in the UBX-ESF-ALG are not stable in time. Note however that each individual set of IMU-mount misalignment angles output in such a case still describes the correct rotation. Moreover, the internal rotation applied for aligning the IMU readings does not suffer from this singularity issue and optimal fusion can still be achieved.

#### **3.2.7.4 Navigation output**

#### **3.2.7.4.1 Local-level north-east-down (NED) frame**

The local-level frame is a geodetic frame with the following features:

- The origin (O) is a point on the Earth's surface;
- The x-axis points to north;
- The y-axis points to east;
- The z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.

The frame is referred to as North-East-Down (NED) since its axes are aligned with the North, East and down directions.

#### **3.2.7.4.2 Vehicle frame**

The vehicle frame is a right-handed 3D Cartesian frame rigidly connected with the vehicle and is used to determine the attitude of the vehicle with respect to the local-level frame. It has the following features:

- The origin (O) is the VRP;
- The x-axis points towards the front of the vehicle;
- The y-axis points towards the right of the vehicle;
- The z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.

## **3.2.7.4.3 Vehicle position and velocity output**

The position and velocity information is output in several messages, for example, UBX-NAV-PVT. Position and velocity computed by the HPS navigation filter are referenced to the IRP.

#### **3.2.7.4.4 Vehicle attitude output**

The transformation between the vehicle frame and the local-level frame is described by three attitude angles about the local-level axes denoted as *vehicle roll*, *vehicle pitch* and *vehicle heading*. All three angles are referred to as *vehicle attitude* and are illustrated in the figure below:





#### **Figure 8: Vehicle attitude output**

The order of the sequence of rotations around the navigation axes defining the vehicle attitude matrix in terms of vehicle attitude angles is illustrated below:



$$
\mathbf{C}_{X} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\phi) & \sin(\phi) \\ 0 & -\sin(\phi) & \cos(\phi) \end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{C}_{Y} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & 0 & -\sin(\theta) \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ \sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) \end{bmatrix} \quad \mathbf{C}_{Z} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\psi) & \sin(\psi) & 0 \\ -\sin(\psi) & \cos(\psi) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

#### **Figure 9: Vehicle attitude definition**

Note that in this figure the body frame corresponds to the vehicle frame.

The vehicle attitude is output in the UBX-NAV-ATT message. The message provides all three angles together with their accuracy estimates.

## **3.2.7.4.5 Vehicle dynamics output**

The UBX-ESF-INS message outputs information about vehicle dynamics provided by the INS, compensated vehicle angular rates, and compensated vehicle acceleration. The acceleration data is free of any gravitational acceleration. Its accuracy is directly dependent on the filter attitude estimation accuracy.

Compensated vehicle dynamics information is output with respect to the vehicle frame.

The message outputs only dynamics information that is directly compensated by the fusion filter. This implies that depending on the solution type and the sensor availability, dynamics along some axes of the vehicle frame might not be available.

## <span id="page-42-0"></span>**3.2.7.5 Sensor data types**

The UBX-ESF-MEAS messages can be used as input and/or output messages. They can provide the following functionality:

- Output the ZED-F9R internal IMU measurements;
- Input external 10Hz wheel tick or speed measurements from a host to ZED-F9R.
- Input external 50Hz Gyro and Accelerometer data from a host to ZED-F9R.

A different number of data fields may be used, and these can contain different types of measurements. The type of each measurement is specified in the UBX-ESF-MEAS.dataType field.

**Table 15: Definition of data types**

## **3.2.7.6 Raw sensor data output**

The UBX-ESF-RAWmessage can be used to access raw sensor measurements. A variable number of data fields may be used in a single message and these can contain different types of measurements. The type of each measurement is specified in the UBX-ESF-RAW.dataType field.

The possible sensors for the data field are accelerometer, gyroscope and temperature readings.The data types are the same as described in the [Sensor](#page-42-0) Data Types section.

The measurements are available at a fixed rate. The sampling rate or other sensor configuration options cannot be changed, they depend on the inertial sensors connected. The raw measurements are output as one sample of every data type per message.

To enable this feature, the UBX-ESF-RAW message must be enabled using CFG-MSGOUT-UBX\_ESF\_RAW-\* keys. If any non-zero rate is selected themessagewill be output at the rate atwhich the sensors are sampled.

- The feature can only be enabled if the active inertial sensors are connected to the GNSS receiver directly via hardware interface.
- Turning on this feature does not disable sensor fusion in the receiver.

## **3.2.7.7 Receiver startup and shutdown**

Continuous dead reckoning is possible over receiver restarts if all following conditions are true:

- Non-volatile storage is available, the save-on-shutdown feature (SOS), or the advanced calibration handling feature is used
- A real-time clock is available or time assistance is provided on startup
- The sensor data stream is only stopped when the vehicle is stationary
- The vehicle is not moved while the receiver is off
- If the heading or the position of the vehicle is changed while the receiver is off, it may trigger a calibration reset. In such a case, the sensors must be re-calibrated.

## <span id="page-43-0"></span>**3.2.8 Priority navigation mode**



## **3.2.8.1 Introduction**

ZED-F9R provides a low-latency position, velocity, and vehicle attitude solution to be output at a high rate by utilizing sensor-based propagation in between GNSS-measurement updates, thus prioritizing the time-critical data.

The receiver issues priority navigation messages first, and non-priority navigation messages when time allows it. The non-priority messages might, therefore, be output with some delay.

**Table 17: NMEA priority navigation messages**

- The ZED-F9R requires an initialization phase if the sensors have not been calibrated. During this initialization, the receiver delivers GNSS-only navigation solution data, still ensuring highrate and low-latency output. The ZED-F9R works optimally in priority navigation mode when the IMU and WT sensors have been calibrated, and the alignment angles are correct.
- If priority navigation mode is enabled, comparing time information of a non-priority UBX message with a priority NMEA message may not be sensible (see the iTOW [timestamps](#page-73-0) section). Thus, it is recommended to compare messages with the same priority level. For instance, comparing the time information of a non-priority UBX message with a non-priority NMEA message (such as NMEA-Standard-ZDA).
- When switching back from priority mode to non-priority mode, theTOWcould jump back in time, similarly, switching from non-priority to priority mode may cause TOW to jump ahead in time.

If a high priority navigation rate has been configured with CFG-RATE-NAV\_PRIO, it is strongly recommended to check (and maybe reduce) the number of enabled output messages. Interface bandwidth constraints may be a limiting factor.

As mentioned in the table above, the allowed range for the priority navigation mode is 0-30 Hz.

When not zero, the receiver outputs navigation data as a set of messages with two priority levels:

- **1.** Priority navigation mode: the navigation solution data is computed and output with high rate and low latency.
- **2.** Non-priority navigation mode: the navigation data is computed and output with low rate and high latency.

When zero, the receiver outputs the navigation data as a set of messages with the same priority level i.e. non-priority navigation mode.

## **3.2.9.1 Introduction**

Supported on ZED-F9R-03B from firmware version HPS 1.30 onwards

This feature utilizes the on-board IMU sensor's interrupt pin to wake up the host. Set the receiver in the software backup mode to use this feature. The software backup mode acts as a sleep mode for the receiver. IMUs are capable of sending discrete signals on acceleration events while the sensor itself could be in low power consumption mode.

## **3.2.9.2 Configuration**

Enabling the wake on motion feature requires two configurations:

- CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE: Is used to enable and set the mode of the wake on motion.
- CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_THLD: Is used to set the required acceleration on a single accelerometer axis for triggering the wake up.

With CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE, the receiver can be configured with four different wake on motion modes. By default the feature is disabled so CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE is set to 0. For the use cases where only the host needs to wake up, the CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE should be set to 1. The receiver will output a discrete signal over the WOM pin whenever motion is detected, but the signal will not wake up the receiver. With CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE set to 2, the IMU interrupt would wake up the receiver and no discrete signal will be output by the receiver over the WOM pin. The last option is where the CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE is set to 3, with this mode the IMU interrupt will wake up both the receiver and output a discrete signal over theWOM pin for the host.The receiver will start normal operation afterwards.

For CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_THLD the value ranges between 1-255, where 1 corresponds to 0 g and 255 to 1 g, where g = 9.81 m/s^2. e.g. for 0.25 g threshold the configured value should be 64. The default value for CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_THLD is 0, which corresponds to the threshold of 0.5 g. The threshold is configured for all axis, so if the acceleration on any axis exceeds the threshold, the IMU interrupt would be triggered and would wake up the host.

With the HPS 1.30 firmware, the wake on motion feature supports the host only option, i.e. CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE should be set to 1. Waking up the receiver is currently not supported





## **3.2.9.3 Procedure to use the wake on motion feature**

The following outlines the procedure when using the wake on motion feature:

- Set the required mode for the wake on motion feature via CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_MODE.
- Depending on the use case, set the required threshold for a single accelerometer axis via CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_THLD.
- Set the desired configuration to all layers and send it to the receiver.
- Afterwards, power cycle the receiver. This will initialize the sensors for wake on motion feature. This only needs to be done once the wake on motion configuration is changed.
- The next step is to set the receiver in software backup mode. The receiver can be set to software backup mode via UBX-RXM-PMREQ message. Duration of the requested task should be set to zero.
- Afterwards, based on the threshold and the mode the IMU interrupt would wake up the configured interface.
- In UBX-RXM-PMREQ message the wakeupSources.extint0 flag should not be disabled for the wake on motion feature.
- The test setup should be equivalent to the final mechanical design to account for damping effects, as the detection threshold will vary depending on the place of installation / dampening.

#### **3.2.9.4 Example use cases**

The following CFG-HW-SENS\_WOM\_THLD values correspond to the bare minimum acceleration that would be produced in each scenario and should be used as a guideline, the specific thresholds will depend significantly on the final installation:

- Opening the door and entering the car: 15 (0.06 g)
- Starting the vehicle and driving out slowly: 25 (0.1 g)
- A bump on a parked car: 50 (0.2 g)
- Hard stopping the vehicle: 200 (0.78 g)

## <span id="page-46-1"></span>**3.3.1 Introduction**



**Figure 10: Geofence**



The geofencing feature allows for the configuration of up to four circular areas (geofences) on the Earth's surface. The receiver will then evaluate for each of these areas whether the current position lies within the area or not and signal the state via UBX messaging and PIO toggling.

## <span id="page-47-0"></span>**3.3.2 Interface**

Geofencing can be configured using the CFG-GEOFENCE-\* configuration group. The geofence evaluation is active whenever there is at least one geofence configured.

The current state of each geofence plus the combined state is output in UBX-NAV-GEOFENCE with every navigation epoch.

## <span id="page-47-1"></span>**3.3.3 Geofence state evaluation**

With every navigation epoch the receiver will evaluate the current solution's position versus the configured geofences. There are three possible outcomes for each geofence:

- *Inside* The position is inside the geofence with the configured confidence level
- *Outside* The position lies outside of the geofence with the configured confidence level
- *Unknown* There is no valid position solution or the position uncertainty does not allow for unambiguous state evaluation

The position solution uncertainty (standard deviation) is multiplied with the configured confidence sigma level and taken into account when evaluating the geofence state (red circle in [Figure](#page-47-4) 11).

<span id="page-47-4"></span>

**Figure 11: Geofence states**

The combined state for all geofences is evaluated as the combination (Union) of all geofences:

- *Inside* The position lies inside of at least one geofence
- *Outside* The position lies outside of all geofences
- *Unknown* All remaining states

A pin is made available to indicate the status of the geofence. See the [GEOFENCE\\_STAT](#page-65-1) interface.

# <span id="page-47-2"></span>**3.4 Primary and secondary output**

## <span id="page-47-3"></span>**3.4.1 Introduction**

u-blox GNSS receivers output various navigation results and data calculated as part of the navigation solution. These include results such as position, altitude, velocity, status flags, accuracy estimate figures, satellite/signal information and more.

The ZED-F9R can provide this output in two streams:

- **Primary output:** Reports the results of a full navigation solution using all capabilities of the ZED-F9R,
- **Secondary output:** Reports the results of a GNSS standalone navigation solution.

Both the primary output and secondary output provide a similar set of information but the two outputs report different results.The primary output is reported in the form of UBX-NAV-\* messages, while the secondary output is reported in the form of UBX-NAV2-\* messages. Therefore, the UBX



message class can be used to distinguish between the primary output and the secondary output. For the specification of the UBX-NAV2-\* messages and for a full list of available UBX-NAV2-\* messages, see the applicable Interface description [[2](#page-125-1)].

The secondary output is complementary to the primary output. It does not provide the full navigation solution of the primary output. It can be used to expand the applications of the ZED-F9R to enable using a second navigation solution in parallel with the primary navigation solution.

The rest of this section describes how to configure and use the secondary output, what is the expected output behavior, and provides examples that illustrate potential uses for the secondary output, while highlighting the differences between the primary and the secondary output.

## <span id="page-48-0"></span>**3.4.2 Configuration**

Configuring the secondary output to the application's needs requires:

- Enabling the secondary output
- Configuring the desired secondary output UBX-NAV2-\* messages
- Optionally, configuring the properties of the secondary output navigation solution

The configuration items relevant to the secondary output are in the CFG-NAV2-\* configuration group. The configuration items for enabling and configuring the output rate of the UBX-NAV2-\* messages are in the CFG-MSGOUT-\* group and are of the form CFG-MSGOUT-UBX\_NAV2\_\*. An example set of secondary output configuration items is shown in the table below. For all available configuration items, see the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

| Configuration item            | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CFG-NAV2-OUT_ENABLED          | Enables secondary output                                         |
| CFG-NAV2-SBAS_USE_INTEGRITY   | Enables using SBAS integrity information in the secondary output |
| CFG-MSGOUT-UBX_NAV2_PVT_*     | Enables UBX-NAV2-PVT secondary output message                    |
| CFG-MSGOUT-UBX_NAV2_TIMEGPS_* | Enables UBX-NAV2-TIMEGPS secondary output message                |

**Table 18: Example secondary output configuration items**

**Enabling the secondary output:** The first necessary step to enable the secondary output is to configure the CFG-NAV2-OUT\_ENABLED configuration item appropriately. This will enable the secondary output navigation solution to run in parallel with the primary output navigation solution. By default, the secondary output is disabled. Note that if you do not follow the next step, there will be no secondary output visible in the ZED-F9R communication interfaces in the form of UBX-NAV2- \* messages.

Both primary and secondary output report a navigation solution computed at the same navigation rate. Enabling the secondary output may affect the maximum achievable navigation update rate due to the extra computational load.

**Configuring the desired secondary output UBX-NAV2-\* messages:** The second necessary step is to configure the desired CFG-MSGGOUT-UBX\_NAV2\_\* configuration items appropriately. These set the message output rates for the UBX-NAV2-\* messages that you wish to output. By default, all UBX-NAV2-\* message output rates are set to 0 and as such are not being output.

Due to the increased message output, the interface load will be higher while the secondary output messages are enabled. Therefore, the interface baud rate may need to be adapted accordingly. Alternatively, it is possible to configure the UBX-NAV2-\* messages with a different output rate from that of their primary output UBX-NAV-\* counterparts.



**Configuring the properties of the secondary output navigation solution:** Optionally, it is possible to configure the properties of the secondary output navigation solution in order to adapt it to the application's needs.

A minimal subset of the primary output navigation solution configuration is available for the secondary output navigation solution configuration. All such available configuration items are in the CFG-NAV2-\* configuration group (see applicable Interface description [\[2](#page-125-1)]).

Configuring any of the CFG-NAV2-\* configuration items changes the behavior of the secondary output navigation solution only and not the primary output one. All such configuration items have a primary output configuration counterpart and have the same default value as their primary output configuration counterpart.

For example, the CFG-NAV2-SBAS\_USE\_INTEGRITY configuration item allows configuring the SBAS integrity feature differently for the primary output and the secondary output. Its primary output counterpart is the CFG-SBAS-USE\_INTEGRITY configuration item and the default value of both configuration items is the same.

## <span id="page-49-0"></span>**3.4.3 Expected output behavior**

Once the secondary output is enabled and the desired secondary output UBX-NAV2-\* messages are configured, the ZED-F9R will output both primary and secondary output data in the form of the enabled UBX-NAV-\* and UBX-NAV2-\* messages respectively.

In every navigation epoch, a set of UBX-NAV-\* messages will be output followed by another set of UBX-NAV2-\* messages. Both sets will be referring to the navigation solution of the same navigation epoch.

Each set will be delimited at its end with a UBX-NAV-EOE or a UBX-NAV2-EOE message respectively. In other words, a UBX-NAV-EOE message will be output at the end of the UBX-NAV-\* class enabled messages and a UBX-NAV2-EOE message will be output at the end of the UBX-NAV2-\* class enabled messages. For example, if only UBX-NAV-PVT, UBX-NAV2-PVT, UBX-NAV-TIMEGPSand UBX-NAV2- TIMEGPS are enabled on the same port with message output rate 1, then every navigation epoch output will be as follows: UBX-NAV-PVT, UBX-NAV-TIMEGPS, UBX-NAV-EOE, UBX-NAV2-PVT, UBX-NAV2-TIMEGPS, UBX-NAV2-EOE.

- Secondary output messages appear after the primary output messages. This results in a higher latency for the secondary output messages than the primary output messages.
- Contrary to UBX-NAV2-\* messages, secondary output NMEA-NAV2-\* messages are not delimited by an NMEA-equivalent to UBX-NAV-EOE.

The specification of the UBX-NAV2-\* messages resembles that of the UBX-NAV-\* messages. The payload specification of a UBX-NAV2 message is identical to the payload specification of its UBX-NAV counterpart, allowing to easily adapt any existing message parsers. The primary output will contain results and data reflecting the full navigation solution of the ZED-F9R. The secondary output will contain results and data reporting a GNSS standalone navigation solution.

## <span id="page-49-1"></span>**3.4.4 Example use cases**

As an example, an application using a ZED-F9R that is operating in RTK sensor fusion mode can enable the secondary output and monitor a GNSS standalone solution to understand the improvements introduced by using high precision sensor fusion.



# <span id="page-50-0"></span>**3.5 SBAS**

The ZED-F9R is capable of receiving multiple SBAS signals concurrently, even from different SBAS systems (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, etc.). They can be tracked and used for navigation simultaneously. Every SBAS satellite that broadcasts ephemeris or almanac information can be used for navigation, just like a normal GNSS satellite.

For receiving correction data, the ZED-F9R automatically chooses the best SBAS satellite as its primary source. It will select only one since the information received from other SBAS satellites is redundant and could be inconsistent. The selection strategy is determined by the proximity of the satellites, the services offered by the satellite, the configuration of the receiver (test mode allowed/ disallowed, integrity enabled/disabled) and the signal link quality to the satellite.

If corrections are available fromthe chosenSBASsatellite and used in the navigation calculation, the differential status will be indicated in several output messages such as UBX-NAV-PVT, UBX-NAV-STATUS, UBX-NAV-SAT, NMEA-GGA, NMEA-GLL, NMEA-RMC and NMEA-GNS (see the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1)). The message UBX-NAV-SBAS provides detailed information about which corrections are available and applied.

The most important SBAS feature for accuracy improvement is ionosphere correction. The measured data from regional Ranging and Integrity Monitoring Stations (RIMS) are combined to make a Total Electron Content (TEC) map. This map is transferred to the receiver via SBAS satellites to allow a correction of the ionosphere error on each received signal.

| Message type | Message content                    | Source  |
|--------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| 0(0/2)       | Test mode                          | All     |
| 1            | PRN mask assignment                | Primary |
| 2, 3, 4, 5   | Fast corrections                   | Primary |
| 6            | Integrity                          | Primary |
| 7            | Fast correction degradation        | Primary |
| 9            | Satellite navigation (ephemeris)   | All     |
| 10           | Degradation                        | Primary |
| 12           | Time offset                        | Primary |
| 17           | Satellite almanac                  | All     |
| 18           | Ionosphere grid point assignment   | Primary |
| 24           | Mixed fast / long-term corrections | Primary |
| 25           | Long-term corrections              | Primary |
| 26           | Ionosphere delays                  | Primary |

#### **Table 19: Supported SBAS messages**

Each satellite services a specific region and its correction signal is only useful within that region. Planning is crucial to determine the best possible configuration, especially in areas where signals from different SBAS systems can be received:

- **Example 1 - SBAS receiver in North America:** In the eastern parts of North America, make sure that EGNOS satellites do not take preference over WAAS satellites. The satellite signals from the EGNOS system should be disallowed by using the PRN mask.
- **Example 2 - SBAS receiver in Europe:** Some WAAS satellite signals can be received in the western parts of Europe, therefore it is recommended that the satellites from all but the EGNOS system should be disallowed using the PRN mask.
- Although u-blox receivers try to select the best available SBAS correction data, it is recommended to configure them to exclude unwanted SBAS satellites.

To configure the SBAS functionalities use the CFG-SBAS-\* configuration group.

**Table 20: SBAS configuration parameters**

When SBAS integrity data is applied, the navigation engine stops using all signals for which no integritydata are available (includingallnon-GPSsignals). It isnot recommendedto enableSBAS integrity on borders of SBAS service regions in order not to inadvertently restrict the number of available signals.

- SBAS integrity information is required for at least 5 GPS satellites. If this condition is not met, SBAS integrity data will not be applied.
- SBAS is only used if no correction service is available. If the connection stream is lost during the operation, the receiver will switch to using the SBAS corrections after the time set in CFG-NAVSPG-CONSTR\_DGNSSTO (60 s by default) has elapsed.
- When the receiver switches from a solution using correction data to a standard position solution, the reference frame of the output position will switch from the one of the correction data to that of the standard position solution. For an SBAS solution this reference frame will be aligned within a few cm of WGS84 (and modern ITRF realizations).

# <span id="page-51-0"></span>**3.6 BeiDou SBAS configuration**

BeiDou satellite based augmentation system (BDSBAS) provides SBAS services to China and surrounding regions. BDSBAS is integrated in the BeiDou system and uses BDS-3 type satellites to broadcast SBAS L1/L5 signal, providing augmentation for BeiDou and GPS systems.

BeiDou SBAS is in testing mode and it is not enabled by default. Enabling it may improve navigation solution by its correction data. To enable the BeiDou SBAS functionality, configure the following configuration items.

<span id="page-51-1"></span>

| Configuration item             | Value              |
|--------------------------------|--------------------|
| CFG-SBAS-ACCEPT_NOT_IN_PRNMASK | BDSBAS             |

| CFG-SBAS-USE_TESTMODE          | TRUE               |

**Table 21: BeiDou SBAS configuration item**

BeiDou SBAS is still in testing mode and it has not been officially released for operational use. Do not use it for safety related applications.



The CFG-SBAS-PRNSCANMASK in[Table](#page-51-1) 21 includes onlyBeiDouSBASPRNs. Alternatively, the BeiDou SBAS PRNs can be added to the default list of PRNs enabled in the firmware or modified list of PRNs that is configured. This allows other SBAS systems to be used if BeiDou SBAS is not available.

# <span id="page-52-0"></span>**3.7 QZSS SLAS**

QZSS SLAS (Sub-meter Level Augmentation Service) is an augmentation technology, which provides correction data for pseudoranges of GPS and QZSS satellites. The correction stream is transmitted on the L1S signal at the L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz).

For more information on QZSS SLAS, visit the website [qzss.go.jp/en/.](http://qzss.go.jp/en/)

QZSS SLAS is only used if no other correction services are available (e.g. RTCM, SPARTN, CLAS). If the connection stream is lost during the operation, the receiver will switch to use the SLAS corrections after the time set in CFG-NAVSPG-CONSTR\_DGNSSTO (60 s by default) has elapsed.

## <span id="page-52-1"></span>**3.7.1 Features**

Multiple QZSS SLAS signals can be received simultaneously.

When receiving QZSS SLAS correction data, the ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver will autonomously select the best QZSS satellite. The selection strategy is determined by the quality of the QZSS L1S signals, the receiver configuration (test mode allowed or not), and the location of the receiver with respect to the QZSS SLAS coverage area. When outside of this coverage area, the receiver will likely fall back to using SBAS corrections.

If QZSS SLAS corrections are used in the navigation solution, the differential status will be indicated in several output messages such as UBX-NAV-PVT, UBX-NAV-STATUS, UBX-NAV-SAT, NMEA-GGA, NMEA-GLL, NMEA-RMC and NMEA-GNS (see the applicable interface description [[2](#page-125-1)]). The message UBX-NAV-SLAS provides detailed information about which corrections are available and applied.

| Message type | Message content                |  |

# <span id="page-53-0"></span>**3.8 Protection level**

Supported from firmware version HPS 1.30 onwards

## <span id="page-53-1"></span>**3.8.1 Introduction**

Critical applications need to know how much trust they can place in their GNSS receiver's output at any given moment. Computed by the GNSS receiver in real-time, the protection level (PL) quantifies the reliability of the position information, to allow systems to change their mode of operation to improve the efficiency and quality of the tasks being performed.

The GNSS receiver's protection level describes the maximum likely position error to a specified degree of confidence. For example, if a GNSS receiver determines its position with a 95% protection level of one meter, there is only a 5% chance that the reported position is more than one meter away from its true position. Like the accuracy estimate of the GNSS receiver, the protection level constantlyfluctuates, influenced by all the common error sources that affect GNSSsolutions. Unlike the accuracy estimate, the confidence level of the protection level is much higher and is validated against specific operating scenarios to ensure that the output bounds the true error.



**Figure 12: PL bounding true position error**

## <span id="page-53-2"></span>**3.8.2 Interface**

The protection level bounds the true position error with a target misleading information risk (TMIR), for example 5[%MI/epoch] (read: 5% probability of having an MI per epoch). The target misleading information risk describes the probability per epoch of having misleading information (MI), that is, the true position error is larger than the protection level and fails to bound the true position error (see [Figure](#page-54-0) 13).



<span id="page-54-0"></span>

#### **Figure 13: Misleading information**

The output of the protection level is published through the UBX-NAV-PL message.

- Protection level computing can be disabled through the CFG-NAVSPG-PL\_ENA configuration item. See the applicable interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1) for availability of the configuration item.
- TMIR is specified in one dimension for PL. It is not specified as a horizontal 2D or 3D value.
- The protection level values (UBX-NAV-PL.plPos1/2/3) are confidence intervals around the reported position (for example, UBX-NAV-PVT or UBX-NAV-HPPOSLLH).
- The target misleading information risk is provided in exponential notation (UBX-NAV-PL.tmirCoeff and UBX-NAV-PL.tmirExp), for example UBX-NAV-PL.tmirCoeff=5 and UBX-NAV-PL.tmirExp=0 results in 5e0 (= 5).

The user may have a threshold defined for the largest acceptable position error for their application. This threshold is known as the Alert Limit. If the reported PL exceeds this threshold, the user shall consider changing the mode of operation of the system or in the worst case declare the system unavailable. Examples of a change in the operating mode of the system could be stopping, reversing the direction of operation, slowing down or calculating a new acceptable error threshold appropriate to the mode of operation. This state is also known as the receiver being unavailable (see [Figure](#page-55-0) 14).

In case the PL is smaller than the alert limit, the receiver is said to be available (see [Figure](#page-55-0) 14).



<span id="page-55-0"></span>

#### **Figure 14: Positioning function**

True position error is generally unknown, unless a very accurate and reliable truth positioning system is reporting an estimate for the true position

When the GNSSenvironment deviates significantly from the normal mode of operation as compared to scenarios where the PL has been validated, a validity flag is set to false to indicate these conditions. These conditions tend to be binary in nature, such as jamming has been detected, or the minimum number of satellites is being observed. UBX-NAV-PL reports a PL validity flag (see UBX-NAV-PL.plPosValid), which indicates whether the PL is usable. This mechanism is not depicted in [Figure](#page-55-0) 14.

- The protection level performance depends on many external and internal factors.Some external factors such as the harsh GNSS environment, correction data, etc. may lead to degraded PL performance.
- The protection level validity is not to be confused with misleading information and is independent of misleading information.

For each navigation epoch and for each coordinate axis, a PL value is provided. The coordinate frame reported is horizontal-ellipse-vertical, then the UBX-NAV-PL contents can be interpreted as follows:

**Table 26: Position PL values**

If the PL coordinate frame is set to invalid (UBX-NAV-PL.plPosFrame = 0), then the PL values shall not be used. If the PL validity flag is cleared (UBX-NAV-PL.plValid =0), the PL values shall not be used. Both must be checked.

Only if the PL is set to valid (UBX-NAV-PL.plPosValid), the PL values (UBX-NAV-PL.plPos1/2/3 and UBX-NAV-PL.plPosHorizOrient) can be used and are reliable with respect to the target misleading information risk.

# <span id="page-56-1"></span>**3.9 Communication interfaces**

u-blox receivers are equipped with a communication interface [6](#page-56-2) which is multi-protocol capable. The interface ports can be used to transmit GNSS measurements, monitor status information and configure the receiver.

A protocol (e.g. UBX, NMEA) can be assigned to several ports simultaneously, each configured with individual settings (e.g. baud rate, message rates, etc.). More than one protocol (e.g. UBX protocol and NMEA) can be assigned to a single port (multi-protocol capability), which is particularly useful for debugging purposes.

The ZED-F9R provides UART1, UART2, SPI, I2C and USB interfaces for communication with a host CPU. The interfaces are configured via the configuration methods described in the applicable interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

| UBX-MON-COMMS portId | Electrical interface |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| 0x0000               | I2C                  |
| 0x0100               | UART1                |
| 0x0101               | Reserved             |
| 0x0200               | Reserved             |
| 0x0201               | UART2                |
| 0x0300               | USB                  |
|                      |                      |

The following table shows the port numbers reported in the UBX-MON-COMMS messages.

<span id="page-56-2"></span><sup>6</sup> The signal names and related terms have been replaced with new terminology in this document.





| Port no. | UBX-MON-COMMS portId | Electrical interface |

**Table 27: Port number assignment**

It is important to isolate interface pins when VCC is removed. They can be allowed to float or they can be connected to a high impedance.

Example isolation circuit is shown below.



**Figure 15: ZED-F9R output isolation**



**Figure 16: ZED-F9R input isolation**

## <span id="page-57-0"></span>**3.9.1 UART**

A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) port consists of an RX and a TX line. Neither handshaking signals nor hardware flow control signals are available. The UART interface protocol and baud rate can be configured but there is no support for setting different baud rates for reception and transmission.

The ZED-F9R includes two UART serial ports. UART1 can be used as a host interface for configuration, monitoring and control. UART2 is available as an optional stand-alone RTCM interface and cannot be used as a host interface.

The UART RX interface will be disabled when more than 100 frame errors are detected during a one-second period. This can happen if the wrong baud rate is used or the UART RX pin is grounded. An error message appears when the UART RX interface is re-enabled at the end of the one-second period.



| Baud rate | Data bits | Parity | Stop bits |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 9600      | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 19200     | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 38400     | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 57600     | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 115200    | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 230400    | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 460800    | 8         | none   | 1         |
| 921600    | 8         | none   | 1         |

**Table 28: Possible UART interface configurations**

The default baud rate is 38400 baud. To prevent buffering problems it is recommended not to run at a lower baud rate than the default.

Allow a short time delay of typically 100 ms between sending a baud rate change message and providing input data at the new rate. Otherwise some input characters may be ignored or the port could be disabled until the interface is able to process the new baud rate.

Note that for protocols such as NMEA or UBX, it does not make sense to change the default word length values (data bits) since these properties are defined by the protocol and not by the electrical interface.

If the amount of data configured is too much for a certain port's bandwidth (e.g. all UBX messages output on a UART port with a baud rate of 9600), the buffer will fill up. Once the buffer space is exceeded, new messages to be sent will be dropped. To prevent message loss, the baud rate and communication speed or the number of enabled messages should be carefully selected so that the expected number of bytes can be transmitted in less than one second.

## <span id="page-58-0"></span>**3.9.2 I2C interface**

An I2C interface is available for communication with an external host CPU or u-blox cellular modules in peripheral mode only. The I2C protocol and electrical interface supports the Fast-mode of the I2C industry standard with a maximum SCL clock frequency of 400 kHz. Backwards compatibility with Standard-mode I2C bus operation is not supported.

The SCL and SDA pins have internal pull-up resistors which should be sufficient for most applications. However, depending on the speed of the host and the load on the I2C lines additional external pull-up resistors may be necessary.

To use the I2C interface D\_SEL pin must be left open.

In designs where the host uses the same I2C bus to communicate with more than one u-blox receiver, the I2C peripheral address for each receiver must be configured to a different value. Typically most u-blox receivers are configured to the same default I2C peripheral address value. To poll or set the I2C peripheral address, use the CFG-I2C-ADDRESS configuration item (see the applicable interface description [[2](#page-125-1)]).

The CFG-I2C-ADDRESS configuration item is an 8-bit value that includes the I2C peripheral address in the 7 most significant bits and the read/write flag in the least significant bit.

## **3.9.2.1 I2C register layout**

The I2C interface allows 256 registers to be addressed. As shown in [Figure](#page-59-0) 17, only three of these are currently implemented.



The data registers 0 to 252 at addresses 0x00 to 0xFC contain reserved information, the result from their reading is currently undefined. The data registers 0 to 252 are 1 byte wide.

At addresses 0xFD and 0xFE it is possible to read the currently available number of bytes.

The register at address 0xFF allows the data stream to be read. If there is no data awaiting transmission from the receiver, then this register delivers value 0xFF, which cannot be the first byte of a valid message. If the message data is ready for transmission, the successive reads of register 0xFF will deliver the waiting message data.

Do not use registers 0x00 to 0xFC. They are reserved for future use and they do not currently provide any meaningful data.

<span id="page-59-0"></span>



## **3.9.2.2 Read access types**

There are two I2C read transfer forms:

- The "random access" form: includes a peripheral register address and allows any register to be read.
- The "current address" form: omits the register address.

[Figure](#page-60-0) 18 shows the format of the first one, the "random access" form of the request. Following the start condition from the controller, the 7-bit device address and the R/W bit (which is a logic low for write access) are clocked onto the bus by the controller transmitter. The receiver answers with an acknowledge (logic low) to indicate that it recognizes the address.

Next, the 8-bit address of the register to be read must be written to the bus. Following the receiver's acknowledgment, the controller again triggers a start condition and writes the device address, but this time the R/W bit is a logic high to initiate the read access. Now, the controller can read 1 to N bytes from the receiver, generating a not-acknowledge and a stop condition after the last byte being read.



<span id="page-60-0"></span>

#### **Figure 18: I2C random read access**

If the second form, "current address" is used, an address pointer in the receiver is used to determine which register to read. This address pointer will increment after each read unless it is already pointing at register 0xFF, the highest addressable register, in which case it remains unaltered.

The initial value of this address pointer at startup is 0xFF, so by default all current address reads will repeatedly read register 0xFF and receive the next byte of message data (or 0xFF if no message data is waiting).



**Figure 19: I2C current address read access**

#### **3.9.2.3 Write access**

The receiver does not provide any write access except for writing UBX and NMEA messages to the receiver, such as configuration or aiding data. Therefore, the register set mentioned in the section Read [access](#page-61-1) is not writeable.

Following the start condition from the controller, the 7-bit device address and the R/W bit (which is a logic low for write access) are clocked onto the bus by the controller transmitter. The receiver answers with an acknowledge (logic low) to indicate that it is responsible for the given address.

The controller can write 2 to N bytes to the receiver, generating a stop condition after the last byte being written. The number of data bytes must be at least 2 to properly distinguish from the write access to set the address counter in random read accesses.







## <span id="page-61-0"></span>**3.9.3 SPI interface**

ZED-F9R has an SPI peripheral interface that can be selected by setting D\_SEL = 0. The SPI peripheral interface is shared with UART1 and I2C port, the physical pins are same. The SPI pins available are:

- SPI\_SDO (TXD)
- SPI\_SDI (RXD)
- SPI\_CS\_N
- SPI\_CLK

See more information about communication interface selection from the [D\\_SEL](#page-63-1) section.

The SPI interface is designed to allow communication to a host CPU. The interface can be operated in peripheral mode only.

The SPI interface transmits data in Most Significant Bit (MSB) first order.

## <span id="page-61-1"></span>**3.9.3.1 Read access**

As the register mode is not implemented for the SPI port, only the UBX/NMEA message stream is provided. This stream is accessed using the back-to-back read and write access (see section [Back](#page-61-2)[to-back](#page-61-2) read and write access below). When no data is available to be written to the receiver, SDI should be held logic high, i.e. all bytes written to the receiver are set to 0xFF.

To prevent the receiver from being busy parsing incoming data, the parsing process is stopped after 50subsequent bytes containing0xFF.The parsing process is re-enabled with thefirst byte not equal to 0xFF.

If the receiver has no more data to send, it sets SDO to logic high, i.e. all bytes transmitted decode to 0xFF. An efficient parser in the host will ignore all 0xFF bytes which are not part of a message and will resume data processing as soon as the first byte not equal to 0xFF is received.

## <span id="page-61-2"></span>**3.9.3.2 Back-to-back read and write access**

The receiver does not provide any write access except for writing UBX and NMEA messages to the receiver, such as configuration or aiding data. For every byte written to the receiver, a byte will simultaneously be read from the receiver. While the controller writes to SDI of the peripheral, at the same time it needs to read from SDO of the peripheral, as any pending data will be output by



the receiver with this access. The data on SDO represents the results from a current address read, returning 0xFF when no more data is available.



**Figure 21: SPI back-to-back read/write access**

## <span id="page-62-0"></span>**3.9.4 USB interface**

A single USB port is provided for host communication purposes.

The USB 2.0 FS (Full speed, 12 Mbit/s) interface can be used for host communication. Due to the hardware implementation, it may not be possible to certify the USB interface.

If the receiver executes code from internal ROM (i.e. when a valid flash firmware image is not detected), the USB behavior can differ compared to executing a firmware image from flash memory. USB host compatibility testing is thus recommended in this scenario.

The ZED-F9R receiver supports only self-powered mode operation in which the receiver is supplied from its own power supply. The V\_USB pin is used to detect the availability of the USB port, i.e. whether the receiver is connected to a USB host.

- USB suspend mode is not supported.
- USB bus-powered mode is not supported.
- It is important to connect V\_USB to ground and leave data lines open when the USB interface is not used in an application.
- The voltage range for V\_USB is specified from 3.0 V to 3.6 V, which differs slightly from the specification for VCC.
- The boot screen is retransmitted on the USB port after enumeration. However, messages generated between receiver startup and USB enumeration are not visible on the USB port.

There are additional hardware requirements if USB is used:

- V\_USB (pin 38) requires 1 uF capacitor mounted adjacent to the pin to ensure correct V\_USB voltage detection
- The V\_USB (Pin 38) voltage should be sourced from an LDO enabled by the module VCC and supplied from the USB host.
- A pull-down resistor is required on the output of this V\_USB LDO
- Apply USB\_DM and USB\_DP series resistors; typically 27 Î©





**Figure 22: ZED-F9R example circuit for USB interface**

R11 = 100 k Î© is recommended

R4, R5 = 27 Î© is recommended

# <span id="page-63-0"></span>**3.10 Predefined PIOs**

In addition to the communication ports, there are some predefined PIOs provided by ZED-F9R to interact with the receiver. These PIOs are described in this section.

If hardware backup mode is used a proper isolation of the interfaces is needed.

## <span id="page-63-1"></span>**3.10.1 D\_SEL**

The D\_SEL pin can be used to configure the functionality of the combined UART1, I2C, and SPI pins. It is possible to configure the pins as UART1 + I2C, or as SPI. SPI is not available unless D\_SEL pin is set to low. See [Table](#page-63-4) 29 below.

<span id="page-63-4"></span>

| Pin no. | D_SEL == 0 | D_SEL == 1 |
|---------|------------|------------|
| 42      | SPI_SDO    | UART1 TXD  |
| 43      | SPI_SDI    | UART1 RXD  |
| 44      | SPI_CS_N   | I2C SDA    |
| 45      | SPI_CLK    | I2C SCL    |

**Table 29: D\_SEL configuration**

## <span id="page-63-2"></span>**3.10.2 RESET\_N**

The ZED-F9R provides the ability to reset the receiver. The RESET\_N pin is an input-only pin with an internal pull-up resistor. Driving RESET\_N low for at least 100 ms will trigger a cold start.

The RESET\_N pin will delete all information and trigger a cold start. It should only be used as a recovery option.

## <span id="page-63-3"></span>**3.10.3 SAFEBOOT\_N**

The ZED-F9R provides a SAFEBOOT\_N pin that is used to command the receiver safeboot mode.

If this pin is low at power up, the receiver starts in safeboot mode and GNSS operation is disabled.

The safeboot mode can be used to recover from situations where the flash content has become corrupted and needs to be restored.

In safeboot mode the receiver runs from a passive oscillator circuit with less accurate timing and hence the receiver is unable to communicate via USB.

In this mode UART1, I2C or SPI communication is possible. For communication via UART1 in safeboot mode, the host must send a training sequence (0x55 0x55 at 9600 baud) to the receiver in order to begin communication. After this the host must wait at least 2 ms before sending any data.



It is recommended to have the possibility to pull the SAFEBOOT\_N pin low in the application. This can be provided using an externally connected test point or a host I/O port.

## <span id="page-64-0"></span>**3.10.4 TIMEPULSE**

The ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver provides a time pulse on the TIMEPULSE pin.

More information about the time pulse feature and its configuration can be found in the Time [pulse](#page-76-0) section.

## <span id="page-64-1"></span>**3.10.5 TX\_READY**

This feature enables each port to define a corresponding pin, which indicates if bytes are ready to be transmitted. A listener can wait on the TX-READY signal instead of polling the I2C or SPI interfaces. The CFG-TXREADY message lets you configure the polarity and the number of bytes in the buffer before the TX-READY signal goes active. By default, this feature is disabled. For USB, this feature is configurable but might not behave as described below due to a different internal transmission mechanism. If the number of pending bytes reaches the threshold configured for this port, the corresponding pin will become active (configurable active-low or active-high), and stay active until the last bytes have been transferred from software to hardware.

This is not necessarily equal to all bytes transmitted, i.e. after the pin has become inactive, up to 16 bytes might still need to be transferred to the host.

The TX\_READY pin can be selected from all PIOs which are not in use (see UBX-MON-HW3 in the applicable interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1) for a list of the PIOs and their mapping). Each TX\_READY pin is exclusively associated to one port and cannot be shared. If PIO is invalid or already in use, only the configuration for the specific TX\_READY pin is ignored, the rest of the port configuration is applied if valid. The acknowledge message does not indicate if the TX-READY configuration is successfully set, it only indicates the successful configuration of the port. To validate successful configuration of the TX\_READY pin, the port configuration should be read back and the settings of TX-READY feature verified (will be set to disabled/all zero if the settings are invalid).

The threshold when TX\_READY is asserted should not be set above 2 kB as it is possible that the internal message buffer limit is reached before this. This results in the TX\_READY pin never being set as the messages are discarded before the threshold is reached.

## **3.10.5.1 Extended TX timeout**

If the host does not communicate over SPI or I2C for more than approximately 2 seconds, the device assumes that the host is no longer using this interface and no more packets are scheduled for this port. This mechanism can be changed by enabling "extended TX timeouts", in which case the receiver delays idling the port until the allocated and undelivered bytes for this port reach 4 kB. This feature is especially useful when using the TX-READY feature with a message output rate of less than once per second, and polling data only when data is available, determined by the TX\_READY pin becoming active.

## <span id="page-64-2"></span>**3.10.6 EXTINT**

EXTINT is an external interrupt pin with fixed input voltage thresholds with respect to VCC. It can be used for functions such as accurate external frequency aiding and on/off control. The external frequency aiding can be used to calibrate the clock. This enables faster fix of satellite signals (UBX-MGA-INI-FREQ or UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\_XXX) and can be used during normal operation or during the production test. Another possibility to use the extint feature is to wake up the receiver after putting



it into backup mode; this can be set up with UBX-RXM-PMREQ. Leave open if unused, this function is disabled by default.

## <span id="page-65-0"></span>**3.10.7 WT and DIR inputs**

ZED-F9R pin 22 (WT) is available as a wheel tick input. Pin 23 (DIR) is available as a direction input (forward/reverse indication).

By default the wheel tick count is derived from the rising edges of the WT input.

The WT input may be configured to use both the rising and falling edges of the wheel tick signal. To use both edges, the wheel tick pulses shall have approximately 1:1 mark:space ratio regardless of speed. The minimum recommended pulse width is 10 us.

For optimal performance the wheel tick resolution should be less than 5 cm. The maximum supported wheel tick resolution is 40 cm.

The wheel tick input shall change frequency linearly with respect to the change in vehicle speed.

When the vehicle is stationary, there shall be no wheel tick pulses at the WT input. This is especially important at system shutdown and startup.

Performance may be affected if there are wheel ticks on the WT pin while the vehicle is stationary.

The DIR input shall indicate whether the vehicle is moving forwards or backwards.

By default, the DIR pin polarity is automatically initialized once the vehicle has reached the required minimum speed (see Accelerated [initialization](#page-37-0) and calibration procedure section). The DIR pin polarity can also be configured with the CFG-SFODO-DIR\_PINPOL key.

Incorrect operation may occur if WT input is used without a matching DIR input.

Alternatively, the vehicleWT(or speed) and DIR inputs can be provided via one of the communication interfaces with UBX-ESF-MEAS messages. In this use case, theWTpin can be configured asEXTINT to provide a time mark for the UBX-ESF-MEAS messages. The DIR pin can be left open.

Do not exceed the maximum voltage of 3.6 V at the WT and DIR inputs.

For more information, see the interface description [\[2](#page-125-1)].

## <span id="page-65-1"></span>**3.10.8 GEOFENCE\_STAT interface**

The ZED-F9R provides a GEOFENCE\_STAT pin that indicates the current geofence status as to whether the receiver is inside any of the active areas.

This feature can be used for example to wake up a sleeping host when a defined geofence condition is reached. It is possible to configure up to four circular areas as geofence locations. Once configured, the receiver continuously compares its current position with the preset geofenced areas.

For more information in this functionality, see Geofence state [evaluation.](#page-47-1)

The receiver toggles the assigned pin according to the combined geofence state.

There are three possible outcomes for each geofence:

- *Inside* The position is inside the geofence with the configured confidence level
- *Outside* The position lies outside of the geofence with the configured confidence level
- *Unknown* There is no valid position solution or the position uncertainty does not allow for unambiguous state evaluation



The GEOFENCE\_STAT pin is always set to high level when the combine geofence state is unknown. The low level can either represent the inside state or the outside state according to the value set in the CFG-GEOFENCE-PINPOL configuration item. If the receiver is in software backup or in a reset, the pin will go to high accordingly.

The GEOFENCE\_STAT pin is the module pin 19 and it is assigned to PIO12.

## <span id="page-66-0"></span>**3.10.9 RTK\_STAT interface**

The ZED-F9R provides an RTK\_STAT pin that provides an indication of the RTK positioning status. It can be used to confirm if a valid stream of correction messages is being received. As valid correction messages we only consider the correction messages that are supported and used by the receiver.

In general, the RTK\_STAT level can be interpreted as follows: Alternating (blinking) pin level, indicates that a valid stream of correction messages is being received and utilized but no RTK fixed mode has been achieved. An active low pin level indicates that RTK fixed mode has been achieved. Otherwise, the pin level is high.

The RTK\_STAT pin status can be mapped to the carrSoln field of the UBX-NAV-PVT and interpreted as follows:

- An active low pin level indicates that RTK fixed mode has been achieved
- Alternating (blinking) pin level, indicates that a valid stream of correction messages is being received and utilized but no RTK fixed mode has been achieved
- An active high pin level indicates that no carrier phase solution is available

## <span id="page-66-1"></span>**3.11 Antenna supervisor**

An active antenna supervisor provides the means to check the antenna for open and short circuits and to shut off the antenna supply if a short circuit is detected. Once enabled, the active antenna supervisor produces status messages, reporting in NMEA and/or UBX protocol.

The antenna supervisor can be configured through the CFG-HW-ANT\_\* configuration items. The current configuration of the active antenna supervisor can also be checked by polling the related CFG-HW\_ANT\_\* configuration items.

The current active antenna status can be determined by polling the UBX-MON-RF message. If an antenna is connected, the initial state after power-up is "Active Antenna OK" in the UBX-MON-RF message in the u-center "Message View".

An active antenna supervisor circuit is connected to the ANT\_DET, ANT\_OFF, ANT\_SHORT\_N pins. For an example the open circuit detection circuit using ANT\_DET, "high" = Antenna detected (antenna consumes current); "low" = Antenna not detected (no current drawn).

The Antenna [supervisor](#page-100-0) circuit section details the required circuit and the following sections explain how to enable and monitor each feature:

## <span id="page-66-2"></span>**3.11.1 Antenna voltage control - ANT\_OFF**

Antenna status (as reported in UBX-MON-RF and UBX-INF-NOTICE messages) is not reported unless the antenna voltage control has been enabled.

Enable the antenna voltage control by setting the configuration item CFG-HW-ANT\_CFG\_VOLTCTRL to true (1).

Result:

â¢ UBX-MON-RF in u-center "Message View": Antenna status = OK. Antenna power status = ON



â¢ ANT\_OFF pin = active high to turn antenna off therefore the pin is low to enable an external antenna.

\$GNTXT,01,01,02,ANTSTATUS=SHORT\*73

- ANT\_OFF = active high therefore still low (still enabled as auto power down is not enabled)
- After a detected antenna short, the reported antenna status will keep on being reported as shorted. If the antenna short detection auto recovery is enabled, then the antenna status can recover after a timeout. To recover the antenna status immediately, a power cycle is required or configuring the antenna short detection functionality off and on.

- UBX-MON-RF in u-center "Message View": Antenna status = SHORT. Antenna power status = OFF
- ANT\_OFF = high (to disable active high)

After a time out period receiver will retest the short condition by enabling ANT\_OFF = LOW

If a short is not present it will report antenna condition is OK:

# <span id="page-68-1"></span>**3.12 Multiple GNSS assistance (MGA)**

The u-blox AssistNow services provide a proprietary implementation of an A-GNSS protocol compatible with u-blox GNSS receivers.



The MGA services consist of AssistNow Online and Offline variants delivered by HTTP or HTTPS protocol. AssistNow Online optionally provides immediate satellite ephemerides, health information and time aiding data suitable for GNSS receiver systems with direct internet access.

When a client device makes an AssistNow request, the service responds with the requested data using standard UBX protocol MGA messages. These messages are ready for direct transmission from the client to the receiver port without requiring any modification.

The ZED-F9R supports AssistNow Online only.

## <span id="page-69-0"></span>**3.12.1 Authorization**

To use the AssistNow services, customers will need to obtain an authorization token from u-blox. Go to https://www.u-blox.com/en/solution/services/assistnow or contact your local technical support to get more information and to request access to the service.

## <span id="page-69-1"></span>**3.12.2 Preserving MGA and operational data during power-off**

The time-to-fix after a receiver power interruption is dependent on the amount of operational data available at startup. Satellite broadcast information plus an estimate of accurate time can be fetched form the AssistNow service. In addition, the following techniques can restore previously stored data prior to power down.

- **Battery-backed RAM:**The receiver operational state stored in this RAM can be maintained during power outages by connecting the V\_BCKP pin to an independent supply, e.g a battery. This is a recommended method as it will maintain all MGA related information plus any user configuration, calibration data and an estimate of time via the Real Time Clock. See section [V\\_BCKP:](#page-93-2) Backup supply voltage for more information.
- **Save-on-shutdown:**The receiver can be instructed to dump its current state to flash memory as part of the shutdown procedure; this data is then automatically retrieved when the receiver is restarted. For more information, see section [Save-on-shutdown](#page-69-2) feature for more info. For information on the UBX-UPD-SOS messages consult the applicable Interface description [[2\]](#page-125-1).
- **Advanced calibration handling:**The receiver can be instructed to dump its current state (UBX-MGA-SF and UBX-NAV-PVAT) to host as part of the shutdown procedure or during the drive; this data is then sent back to the receiver when the receiver is restarted. For more information, see section Advanced [calibration](#page-70-0) handling for more info.
- **Database dump:** The receiver can be made to dump the state of its navigation database in the form of a sequence of UBX messages reported to the host; these messages can be stored by the host and then sent back to the receiver when it has been restarted. See the description of the UBX-MGA-DBD messages in the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1) for more information.

## <span id="page-69-2"></span>**3.12.3 Save-on-shutdown feature**

The save-on-shutdown feature (SOS) enables the u-blox receiver to store the contents of the battery-backed RAM to an external flash memory and restore it upon startup. This allows the ublox receiver to preserve some of the features available only with a battery backup (preserving configuration, IMU calibration, and satellite orbit knowledge) without having a battery backup supply present. It does not, however, preserve any kind of time knowledge. Save-on-shutdown must be commanded by the host. The restoring of data on startup is automatically done if the corresponding data is present in the flash. Data expiration is not checked.

The following outlines the suggested shutdown procedure when using the save-on-shutdown feature:

â¢ With the UBX-CFG-RST message, the host commands the u-blox receiver to stop, specifying reset mode 0x08 ("Controlled GNSS stop") and a BBR mask of 0 ("Hotstart").



- The host commands the saving of the contents of BBR to the flash memory using the UBX-UPD-SOS-BACKUP message.
- For a valid request the u-blox receiver reports on the success of the backup operation with a UBX-UPD-SOS-ACK message.
- The host powers off the u-blox receiver.

The startup procedure is as follows:

- The host powers on the u-blox receiver.
- The u-blox receiver detects the previously stored data in the flash. It restores the corresponding memory and reports the success of the operation with a UBX-UPD-SOS-RESTORED message on the port on which it had received the save command message (if the output protocol filter on that port allows it). It does not report anything if no stored data has been detected.
- Additionally the u-blox receiver outputs a UBX-INF-NOTICE and/or a NMEA-TXT message with the contents RESTORED in the boot screen (depends on the configuration of the port and information messages) upon success.
- Optionally the host can deliver coarse time assistance using UBX-MGA-INI-TIME\_UTC for better startup performance.

Once the u-blox receiver has started up it is recommended to delete the stored data using a UBX-UPD-SOS-CLEAR message. The u-blox receiver responds with a UBX-ACK-ACK / UBX-ACK-NAK message.

**CAUTION** Note that the save-on-shutdown feature works correctly only when the receiver has a valid time information when saving the SOS-BACKUP.

## <span id="page-70-0"></span>**3.12.4 Advanced calibration handling**

Supported from firmware version HPS 1.30 onwards

The advanced calibration handling feature enables a host to poll and later send sensor initialization and calibration parameters. This information can be used to aid quick recovery of the receiver into sensor fusion or dead reckoning mode following a device reset or power down, especially when the battery backup is not provided or the save-on-shutdown feature is not used.

The following points outline the procedure when using the advanced calibration handling feature:

- Host should poll UBX-MGA-SF regularly (optimal time: every 5 min.) after the fusion mode has been achieved. The UBX-ESF-STATUS.fusionMode field should be set to 1:FUSION before polling the UBX-MGA-SF message.
- Receiver replies with one or more UBX-MGA-SF messages. These messages should be stored at the host side.
- In the event of a reset or a power down, host can send the latest stored UBX-MGA-SF messages to the receiver. If there is a sudden power off, the user has to provide the last known position and the attitude solution to the receiver after the power cycle.
- The receiver attempts to reach sensor fusion mode using the data available in these messages.
- Depending on the availability of the GNSS signals the receiver can switch to either fusion mode (3D + DR) or dead reckoning mode (DR only). Host can poll UBX-ESF-STATUS to track the status of the sensors' calibration.
- UBX-MGA-SF message is not output periodically, therefore it is required that the host polls the message regularly. This ensures that the host saves the latest parameters required for quick recovery into sensor fusion mode.
- Make sure to send the latest UBX-MGA-SF messages to the receiver. Sending outdated messages could mean the receiver will take longer to reach sensor fusion mode.



- Only send the saved UBX-MGA-SF messages to the same receiver they were obtained from.
- After the power cycle, the user needs to provide the last known position and the attitude via UBX-MGA-INI-POS and UBX-MGA-INI-ATT messages.The information can be taken from UBX-NAV-PVT and UBX-NAV-ATT or UBX-NAV-PVAT.
- Sending only the UBX-MGA-SF message will be rejected by the receiver even if the receiver is in 3D-only mode.







# <span id="page-72-0"></span>**3.13 Clocks and time**

This section introduces and explains the concepts of receiver clocks and time bases.

## <span id="page-72-1"></span>**3.13.1 Receiver local time**

The receiver is dependent on a local oscillator for both the operation of its radio parts and also for timing within its signal processing. No matter what nominal frequency the local oscillator has, u-blox receivers subdivide the oscillator signal to provide a 1-kHz reference clock signal, which is used to drivemany of the receiver's processes. In particular, themeasurement of satellite signals is arranged to be synchronized with the "ticking" of this 1-kHz clock signal.

When the receiver first starts, it has no information about how these clock ticks relate to other time systems; it can only count time in 1 millisecond steps. However, as the receiver derives information from the satellites it is tracking or from aiding messages, it estimates the time that each 1-kHz clock tick takes in the time base of the chosen GNSS system. This estimate of GNSS time based on the local 1-kHz clock is called receiver local time.

As receiver local time is a mapping of the local 1-kHz reference onto a GNSS time base, it may experience occasional discontinuities, especially when the receiver first starts up and the information it has about the time base is changing. Indeed, after a cold start, the receiver local time will initially indicate the length of time that the receiver has been running. However, when the receiver obtains some credible timing information from a satellite or an aiding message, it will jump to an estimate of GNSS time.

## <span id="page-72-2"></span>**3.13.2 Navigation epochs**

Each navigation solution is triggered by the tick of the 1-kHz clock nearest to the desired navigation solution time. This tick is referred to as a **navigation epoch**. If the navigation solution attempt is successful, one of the results is an accurate measurement of time in the time base of the chosen GNSS system, called **GNSS system time**. The difference between the calculated GNSS system time and receiver local time is called **clock bias** (and **clock drift** is the rate at which this bias is changing).

In practice the receiver's local oscillator will not be as stable as the atomic clocks to which GNSS systems are referenced and consequently clock bias will tend to accumulate. However, when selecting the next navigation epoch, the receiver will always try to use the 1-kHz clock tick which it estimates to be closest to the desired fix period as measured in GNSS system time. Consequently the number of 1-kHz clock ticks between fixes will occasionally vary. This means that when producing one fix per second, there will normally be 1000 clock ticks between fixes, but sometimes, to correct drift away from GNSS system time, there will be 999 or 1001.

The GNSS system time calculated in the navigation solution is always converted to a time in both the GPS and UTC time bases for output.

Clearly when the receiver has chosen to use the GPS time base for its GNSS system time, conversion to GPS time requires no work at all, but conversion to UTC requires knowledge of the number of leap seconds since GPS time started (and other minor correction terms). The relevant GPS-to-UTC conversion parameters are transmitted periodically (every 12.5 minutes) by GPS satellites, but can also be supplied to the receiver via the UBX-MGA-GPS-UTC aiding message. By contrast, when the receiver has chosen to use the GLONASS time base as its GNSS system time, conversion to GPS time is more difficult as it requires knowledge of the difference between the two time bases, but as GLONASS time is closely linked to UTC, conversion to UTC is easier.

When insufficient information is available for the receiver to perform any of these time base conversions precisely, predefined default offsets are used. Consequently plausible times are nearly



always generated, but they may be wrong by a few seconds (especially shortly after receiver start). Depending on the configuration of the receiver, such "invalid" times may well be output, but with flags indicating their state (e.g. the "valid" flags in UBX-NAV-PVT).

u-blox receivers employ multiple GNSS system times and/or receiver local times (in order to support multiple GNSSsystems concurrently), so users should not use UBX messages reporting GNSS system time or receiver local time. It is recommended to use messages that report UTC time and other messages are retained only for backwards compatibility reasons.

## <span id="page-73-0"></span>**3.13.3 iTOW timestamps**

All the main UBX-NAV messages (and some other messages) contain an **iTOW** field which indicates the GPS time at which the navigation epoch occurred. Messages with the same iTOW value can be assumed to have come from the same navigation solution.

With Priority [navigation](#page-43-0) mode enabled, iTOW can be used as an epoch collector only for messages of the same group (e.g. priority navigation messages with the same iTOW value can be assumed to have come from the same navigation solution).

Note that iTOW values may not be valid (i.e. they may have been generated with insufficient conversion data) and therefore it is not recommended to use the iTOW field for any other purpose.

The original designers of GPS chose to express time/date as an integer week number (starting with the first full week in January 1980) and a time of week (often abbreviated to TOW) expressed in seconds. Manipulating time/date in this form is far easier for digital systems than the more conventional year/month/day, hour/minute/second representation. Consequently, most GNSS receivers use this representation internally, only converting to a more conventional form at external interfaces. The iTOW field is the most obvious externally visible consequence of this internal representation.

If reliable absolute time information is required, users are recommended to use the UBX-NAV-PVT navigation solution message which also contains additional fields that indicate the validity (and accuracy in UBX-NAV-PVT) of the calculated times (see also the [GNSS times](#page-73-1) section below for further messages containing time information).

## <span id="page-73-1"></span>**3.13.4 GNSS times**

Each GNSS has its own time reference for which detailed and reliable information is provided in the messages listed in the table below.

| Time reference | Message          |
|----------------|------------------|
| GPS time       | UBX-NAV-TIMEGPS  |
| BeiDou time    | UBX-NAV-TIMEBDS  |
| GLONASS time   | UBX-NAV-TIMEGLO  |
| Galileo time   | UBX-NAV-TIMEGAL  |
| QZSS time      | UBX-NAV-TIMEQZSS |
| UTC time       | UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC  |

**Table 30: GNSS times**

## <span id="page-73-2"></span>**3.13.5 Time validity**

Information about the validity of the time solution is given in the following form:

â¢ Time validity: Information about time validity is provided in the valid flags (e.g. validDate and validTime flags in the UBX-NAV-PVT message). If these flags are set, the time is known and considered valid for use. These flags are shown in table GNSS times in section GNSS times above as well as in the UBX-NAV-PVT message.



- Time validity confirmation: Information about confirmed validity is provided in the confirmedDate and confirmedTime flags in the UBX-NAV-PVT message. If these flags are set, the time validity can be confirmed by using an additional independent source, meaning that the probability of the time to be correct is very high. Note that information about time validity confirmation is only available if the confirmedAvai bit in the UBX-NAV-PVT message is set.
- validDate means that the receiver has knowledge of the current date. However, it must be noted that this date might be wrong for various reasons. Only when the confirmedDate flag is set, the probability of the incorrect date information drops significantly.
- validTime means that the receiver has knowledge of the current time. However, it must be noted that this time might be wrong for various reasons. Only when the confirmedTime flag is set, the probability of incorrect time information drops significantly.
- fullyResolved means that the UTC time is known without full seconds ambiguity. When deriving UTC time from GNSS time the number of leap seconds must be known, with the exception of GLONASS. It might take several minutes to obtain such information from the GNSS payload. When the one second ambiguity has not been resolved, the time accuracy is usually in the range of ~20s.

## <span id="page-74-0"></span>**3.13.6 UTC representation**

UTC time is used in many NMEA and UBX messages. In NMEA messages it is always reported rounded to the nearest hundredth of a second. Consequently, it is normally reported with two decimal places (e.g. 124923.52). Although compatibility mode (selected using CFG-NMEA-COMPAT) requires three decimal places, rounding to the nearest hundredth of a second remains, so the extra digit is always 0.

UTC time is also reported within some UBX messages, such as UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC and UBX-NAV-PVT. In these messages date and time are separated into seven distinct integer fields. Six of these (year, month, day, hour, min and sec) have fairly obvious meanings and are all guaranteed to match the corresponding values in NMEA messages generated by the same navigation epoch. This facilitates simple synchronization between associated UBX and NMEA messages.

The seventh field is called nano and it contains the number of nanoseconds by which the rest of the time and date fields need to be corrected to get the precise time. So, for example, the UTC time 12:49:23.521 would be reported as: hour: 12, min: 49, sec: 23, nano: 521000000.

It is however important to note that the first six fields are the result of rounding to the nearest hundredth of a second. Consequently the nano value can range from -5000000 (i.e. -5 ms) to +994999999 (i.e. nearly 995 ms).

When the nano field is negative, the number of seconds (and maybe minutes, hours, days, months or even years) will have been rounded up. Therefore, some or all of them must be adjusted in order to get the correct time and date. Thus in an extreme example, the UTC time 23:59:59.9993 on 31st December 2011 would be reported as: year: 2012, month: 1, day: 1, hour: 0, min: 0, sec: 0, nano: -700000.

Of course, if a resolution of one hundredth of a second is adequate, negative nano values can simply be rounded up to 0 and effectively ignored.

The UBX-NAV-TIMEUTC message gives information about UTC time reference clock.



The preferred variant of UTC time can be specified using CFG-NAVSPG-UTCSTANDARD configuration item.

## <span id="page-75-0"></span>**3.13.7 Leap seconds**

Occasionally it is decided (by one of the international time keeping bodies) that, due to the slightly uneven spin rate of the Earth, UTC has moved sufficiently out of alignment with mean solar time (i.e. the Sun no longer appears directly overhead at 0 longitude at midday). A "leap second" is therefore announced to bring UTC back into close alignment. This normally involves adding an extra second to the last minute of the year, but it can also happen on 30th June. When this happens UTC clocks are expected to go from 23:59:59 to 23:59:60 and only then on to 00:00:00.

It is also theoretically possible to have a negative leap second, in which case there will only be 59 seconds in a minute and 23:59:58 will be followed by 00:00:00.

u-blox receivers are designed to handle leap seconds in their UTC output and consequently users processing UTC times from either NMEA or UBX messages should be prepared to handle minutes that are either 59 or 61 seconds long.

Leap second information can be polled from the u-blox receiver with the message UBX-NAV-TIMELS.

## <span id="page-75-1"></span>**3.13.8 Real-time clock**

u-blox receivers contain circuitry to support a real-time clock, which (if correctly fitted and powered) keeps time while the receiver is otherwise powered off. When the receiver powers up, it attempts to use the real-time clock to initialize receiver local time and in most cases this leads to appreciably faster first fixes.

## <span id="page-75-2"></span>**3.13.9 Date**

All GNSS frequently transmit information about the current time within their data message. In most cases, this is a time of week (often abbreviated to TOW), which indicates the elapsed number of seconds since the start of the week (midnight Saturday/Sunday). In order to map this to a full date, it is necessary to know the week and so the GNSS also transmit a week number, typically every 30 seconds. Unfortunately the GPS L1C/A data message was designed in a way that only allows the bottom 10 bits of the week number to be transmitted. This is not sufficient to yield a completely unambiguous date as every 1024 weeks (a bit less than 20 years), the transmitted week number value "rolls over" back to zero. Consequently, GPS L1 receivers cannot tell the difference between, for example, 1980, 1999 or 2019 etc.

Fortunately, although BeiDou and Galileo have similar representations of time, they transmit sufficient bits for the week number to be unambiguous for the foreseeable future (the first ambiguity will be in 2078 for Galileo and not until 2163 for BeiDou). GLONASS has a different structure, based on a time of day, but again transmits sufficient information to avoid any ambiguity during the expected lifetime of the system (the first ambiguous date will be in 2124). Therefore, ublox 9 receivers using Protocol Version 24 and above regard the date information transmitted by GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo to be unambiguous and, where necessary, use this to resolve any ambiguity in the GPS date.

Customers attaching u-blox receivers to simulators should be aware that GPStime is referenced to 6th January 1980, GLONASS to 1st January 1996, Galileo to 22nd August 1999 and BeiDou to 1st January 2006; the receiver cannot be expected to work reliably with signals simulated before these dates.



## **3.13.9.1 GPS-only date resolution**

In circumstances where only GPS L1C/A signals are available and for receivers with earlier firmware versions, the receiver establishes the date by assuming that all week numbers must be at least as large as a reference rollover week number. This reference rollover week number is hard-coded at compile time and is normally set a few weeks before the software is completed, but it can be overridden by CFG-NAVSPG-WKNROLLOVER configuration item to any value the user wishes.

The following example illustrates how this works: Assume that the reference rollover week number set in the firmware at compile time is 1524 (which corresponds to a week in calendar year 2009, but would be transmitted by the satellites as 500). In this case, if the receiver sees transmissions containing week numbers in the range of 500 ... 1023, these will be interpreted as week numbers 1524 ... 2047 (calendar year 2009 ... 2019), whereas transmissions with week numbers from 0 to 499 are interpreted as week numbers 2048 ... 2547 (calendar year 2019 ... 2028).

It is important to set the reference rollover week number appropriately when supplying u-blox receivers with simulated signals, especially when the scenarios are in the past.

## <span id="page-76-0"></span>**3.13.10 Time pulse**

## **3.13.10.1 Introduction**

u-blox receivers include a time pulse function providing clock pulses with configurable duration and frequency. The time pulse function can be configured using the CFG-TP-\* configuration group. The UBX-TIM-TP message provides time information for the next pulse and the time source.



#### **Figure 24: Time pulse**

## **3.13.10.2 Recommendations**

- The time pulse can be aligned to a wide variety of GNSS times or to variants of UTC derived from them (see the section on [time bases](#page-77-0)). However, it is strongly recommended that the choice of time base is aligned with the available GNSS signals (so to produce GPS time or UTC(USNO), ensure GPS signals are available, and for Galileo time or UTC(EU) ensure the presence of Galileo signals, etc). This will involve coordinating the setting of CFG-SIGNAL-\* configuration group with the choice of time pulse time base.
- When using time pulse for timing applications requiring absolute time accuracy, e.g. with requirements specifying offset to UTC, it is recommended to calibrate the user's full setup for TP output against a reference timing source. To achieve best absolute and consistent accuracy (e.g. for mass deployment), it is recommended that the user should calibrate each single setup and calibrate under different GNSS modes and different temperatures which are applicable to



the user's application and operating requirements. The user should take the calibrated values and configure the compensation accordingly (see the section on Time pulse [configuration](#page-78-0))

- To get the best timing accuracy with the antenna, a fixed and *accurate* position is needed.
- If relative time accuracy between multiple receivers is required, do not mix receivers of different product families. If this is required, the receivers must be calibrated accordingly, by setting cable delay and user delay.
- The recommended configuration when using the UBX-TIM-TP message is to set both the measurement rate (CFG-RATE-MEAS) and the time pulse frequency (CFG-TP-\*) to 1 Hz.
- Since the rate of UBX-TIM-TP is bound to 1 Hz, more than one UBX-TIM-TP message can appear between two pulses if the time pulse frequency is set larger than 1 Hz. In this case all UBX-TIM-TP messages in between time pulses T1 and T2 belong to T2 and the last UBX-TIM-TP before T2 reports the most accurate quantization error. In general, if the time pulse rate is not configured to 1 Hz, there will not be a single UBX-TIM-TP message for each time pulse.

The sequential order of the signal present at theTIMEPULSEpinand the respective outputmessage for the simple case of 1 pulse per second (1PPS) is shown in the following figure.



#### **Figure 25: Time pulse and TIM-TP**

#### <span id="page-77-0"></span>**3.13.10.3 GNSS time bases**

GNSS receivers must handle a variety of different time bases as each GNSS has its own reference system time. What is more, although each GNSS provides a model for converting their system time into UTC, they all support a slightly different variant of UTC. So, for example, GPS supports a variant of UTC as defined by the US National Observatory, while BeiDou uses UTC from the National Time Service Center, China (NTSC). While the different UTC variants are normally closely aligned, they can differ by as much as a few hundreds of nanoseconds.

Although u-blox receivers can combine a variety of different GNSS times internally, the user must choose a single type of GNSS time and, separately, a single type of UTC for input (on EXTINT pins) and output (via the TIMEPULSE pin) and the parameters reported in corresponding messages.

The CFG-TP-TIMEGRID\_TP\* configuration item allows the user to choose between any of the supported GNSS (Galileo, GPS, BeiDou, etc.) time bases and UTC. Also, the CFG-NAVSPG-UTCSTANDARD configuration item allows the user to select which variant of UTC the receiver should use. This includes an "automatic" option which causes the receiver to select an appropriate UTC version itself, based on the enabled GNSS constellations. For firmware versions prior to , the order of preference is:

- USNO if GPS is enabled
- SU if GLONASS is enabled
- NTSC if BeiDou is enabled
- European if Galileo is enabled



â¢ NPLI if NAVIC is enabled

The receiver will assume that an input time pulse uses the same GNSS time base as specified for the time pulse output. So, if the user selects Galileo time for time pulse output, any time pulse input must also be aligned to Galileo time (or to the separately chosen variant of the UTC). When UTC is selected for the time pulse output, any GNSS time pulse input must be aligned to GPS time.

- u-blox receivers allow users to independently choose GNSS signals used in the receiver (using CFG-SIGNAL-\*) and the input/output time base (using CFG-TP-\*). For example, it is possible to instruct the receiver to use GPS and Galileo satellite signals to generate BeiDou time. This practice will compromise time pulse accuracy if the receiver cannot measure the timing difference between the constellations directly and is therefore not recommended.
- The information that allows GNSS times to be converted to the associated UTC times is only transmitted by the GNSS at relatively infrequent periods. For example GPS transmits UTC(USNO) information only once every 12.5 minutes. Therefore, if a time pulse is configured to use a variant of UTC time, after a cold start, substantial delays before the receiver has sufficient information to start outputting the time pulse can be expected.

## **3.13.10.4 Time pulse configuration**

u-blox ZED-F9R receivers provide a time pulse (TIMEPULSE) signal with a configurable pulse period, length and polarity (rising or falling edge).

It is possible to define different signal behavior (i.e. output frequency and pulse length) depending on whether or not the receiver is locked to a reliable time source. Time pulse signal can be configured using the configuration group CFG-TP-\*.

## <span id="page-78-0"></span>**3.13.10.5 Configuring time pulse with CFG-TP-\***

The configuration group CFG-TP-\* can be used to change the time pulse settings, and includes the following parameters defining the pulse:

- **timepulse enable** If this item is set, the time pulse is active.
- **frequency/period type** Determines whether the time pulse is interpreted as frequency or period.
- **length/ratio type** Determines whether the time pulse length is interpreted as length [us] or pulse ratio [%].
- **antenna cable delay** Signal delay owning to RF components (e.g. antenna, cable, and splitter etc.) before the receiver input. This delay parameter affects the receiver calculation of GNSS time and it is used to compensate for the signal transit time prior to the receiver and any uncompensated delay from the receiver; a positive value compensates this delay, i.e. advances the time pulse
- **pulse frequency/period** Frequency or pulse time period when locked mode is not configured or active.
- **pulse frequency/period lock** Frequency or pulse time period, as soon as the receiver has calculated a valid time from a received signal. Only used if the corresponding item is set to use another setting in locked mode.
- **pulse length/ratio** Length or duty cycle of the generated pulse, either specifies a time or ratio for the pulse to be on/off.
- **pulse length/ratio lock** Length or duty cycle of the generated pulse, as soon as the receiver has calculated a valid time from a received signal. Only used if the corresponding item is set to use another setting in locked mode.
- **user delay** A time offset of the TP output for adjustment in a user application. It adjusts the time pulse position only with respect to GNSS time. Configuring a positive value will add a delay, i.e. retard the pulse with respect to GNSS time. Conversely, a negative value will advance the pulse. This configuration is available for all supported TP outputs.





- **lock to GNSS freq** If this item is set, uses the frequency gained from the GNSS signal information rather than the local oscillator's frequency.
- **locked other setting** If this item is set, the alternative setting will be used as soon as the receiver can calculate a valid time. This mode can be used, for example, to disable time pulse if the time is not locked, or to indicate a lock with different duty cycles.
- **align to TOW** If this item is set, pulses are aligned to the top of a second.
- **polarity** If set, the first edge of the pulse is a rising edge (pulse polarity: rising).
- **grid UTC/GNSS** Selection between UTC and various GNSS time grids. Also affects the time output by UBX-TIM-TP message.

The maximum pulse length cannot exceed the pulse period.

Time pulse settings shall be chosen in such a way that neither the high nor the low period of the output is less than 50 ns (except when disabling it completely), otherwise pulses can be lost.

#### **3.13.10.5.1 Example**

The example below shows the 1PPS TIMEPULSE signal generated on the time pulse output according to the specific parameters of the CFG-TP-\* configuration group:

- **CFG-TP-TP1\_ENA** = 1
- **CFG-TP-PULSE\_DEF** = 0 (PERIOD)
- **CFG-TP-PULSE\_LENGTH\_DEF** = 1 (LENGTH)
- **CFG-TP-PERIOD\_TP1** = 1 000 000 Âµs
- **CFG-TP-LEN\_TP1** = 100 000 Âµs
- **CFG-TP-TIMEGRID\_TP1** = 1 (GPS)
- **CFG-TP-ALIGN\_TO\_TOW\_TP1** = 1
- **CFG-TP-USE\_LOCKED\_TP1** = 1
- **CFG-TP-POL\_TP1** = 1
- **CFG-TP-PERIOD\_LOCK\_TP1** = 1 000 000 Âµs
- **CFG-TP-LEN\_LOCK\_TP1** = 100 000 Âµs

The 1 Hz output is maintained whether or not the receiver is locked to GPS time. The alignment to TOW can only be maintained when GPS time is locked.



**Figure 26: Time pulse signal with the example parameters**

## <span id="page-79-0"></span>**3.13.11 Time mark**

The receiver can be used to provide an accurate measurement of the time at which a pulse was detected on the external interrupt pin. The reference time can be chosen by setting the time source parameter to UTC, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo or local time in the CFG-TP-\* configuration group. The UTC standard can be set in the CFG-NAVSPG-\* configuration group. The delay figures defined with CFG-TP-\* are also applied to the results output in the UBX-TIM-TM2 message.

A UBX-TIM-TM2 message is output at the next epoch if



- The UBX-TIM-TM2 message is enabled, and
- A rising or falling edge was triggered since last epoch on one of the EXTINT channels.

The UBX-TIM-TM2 messages includes the time of the last time mark, new rising/falling edge indicator, time source, validity, number of marks and an accuracy estimate.

Only the last rising and falling edge detected between two epochs is reported since the output rate of the UBX-TIM-TM2 message corresponds to the measurement rate configured with CFG-RATE-MEAS (see [Figure](#page-80-1) 27 below).

# <span id="page-80-0"></span>**3.14 Security**

The security concept of ZED-F9R covers:

- the security of the receiver
- communication between the receiver and the GNSS satellites

Some receiver security functions monitor and detect threats and report them to the host system. Other security functions mitigate threats and allow the receiver to operate normally.

The table below gives an overview about possible threats and which functionality is available to detect and/or mitigate it.



| Threat                   | u-blox solution                               |  |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--|

**Table 31: u-blox security options**

## <span id="page-81-0"></span>**3.14.1 Spoofing detection and monitoring**

Spoofing is the process where a counterfeit GNSS signal is transmitted locally to deceive the receiver/user and produce an erroneous position fix and/or time solution.

The detection algorithm monitors GNSS signals for implausible changes or inconsistencies.These are evaluated with regards to spoofing.

Certain spoofing detection mechanisms rely on signal transition from an initially genuine one to a spoofed version. Hence, detection is not possible if the receiver is started under spoofing conditions. The detection algorithms also rely on availability of signals from multiple GNSS constellations to improve the spoofing detection capabilities.

Furthermore, with HPS 1.40, the receiver supports sensor-based spoofing detection. If the sensors are initialized, the receiver detects the presence of spoofing by comparing GNSS information against the sensor data.

Currently, the sensor-based spoofing detection is only optimized for automotive dynamic model. ZED-F9R utilizies only the wheel tick (odometer input) sensor for the spoofing detection.

If the sensors are not calibrated and spoofing is detected, the spoofing detection flag may not be sustained for a long period of time.

## <span id="page-81-1"></span>**3.14.2 Jamming and interference detection and monitoring**

Intentional and/or unintentional jamming of GNSSreceivers candegrade the quality of GNSSsignals and receiver performance. All u-blox receivers can detect and monitor jamming and report it to the user. The monitoring function is always enabled to inform the user about interference in the GNSS RF bands.

## <span id="page-81-2"></span>**3.14.3 Spoofing and jamming indication**

The UBX-SEC-SIG message provides a direct method for monitoring the current security status at each navigation epoch to alert the host about potential jamming or spoofing events.

The UBX-SEC-SIGLOG message provides a log of past events triggered by jamming or spoofing detection.

Each event is a combination of a detection type and an event type, where the event type 'indication started' and 'indication stopped' and also the event type 'indication triggered' and 'indication timeout' form a pair.

A maximum of 16 events are logged and new events take precedence over the past events in the log. Power cycles and restarts of the receiver reset the log, deleting its content.

See the applicable Interface description [\[2\]](#page-125-1).

## <span id="page-82-2"></span>**3.14.4.1 Secure boot**

The ZED-F9R boots onlywithfirmware images that are signedby u-blox.Thisprevents the execution of non-genuine firmware images on the receiver.

## <span id="page-82-3"></span>**3.14.4.2 Secure firmware update**

The firmware image is signed by u-blox. The ZED-F9R verifies the signature during the firmware update.

#### <span id="page-82-4"></span>**3.14.4.3 Receiver configuration lock**

The receiver configuration lock feature ensures that no configuration changes are possible once the feature is enabled. The configuration lock is enabled by setting the configuration item CFG-SEC-CFG\_LOCK to "true".

The configuration lock can be applied to different configuration layers including the RAM, BBR, and flash memory. At startup, the receiver constructs the configuration database from different configuration layers and maintains it in the run-time RAM memory. When the configuration lock is set in the run-time RAM, the receiver configuration cannot be changed on any configuration layer.

For more information on the configuration layers including the order of priority they are applied in, see the applicable interface description [[2](#page-125-1)].

The configuration lock set on a configuration layer in volatile memory (RAM, BBR) is removed when the memory is cleared. However, the configuration lock set in non-volatile memory (flash memory) is permanent apart from one exception: during firmware upload to flash memory, the flash is erased during the process causing the configuration lock to be cleared. Refer to [Firmware](#page-89-1) upload for more information on firmware update.

To test the lock functionality, set it on the RAM configuration layer. After a power cycle, the information on RAM layer is cleared and the lock is no longer set.

It is recommended to apply the configuration lock on the same layer the configuration is stored.

An example of use case is that the host application locks the receiver configuration. A user communicating with the ZED-F9R through any of the available interfaces can poll, enable or send messages, but cannot change the configuration by sending UBX configuration messages.

## <span id="page-82-1"></span>**3.15.1 Broadcast navigation data**

This section describes the data reported via UBX-RXM-SFRBX.

UBX-RXM-SFRBX reports the broadcast navigation data message the receiver has collected from each tracked signal.When enabled, a separatemessage is generated each time the receiver decodes a complete subframe of data from a tracked signal. The data bits are reported as received, including preambles and error checking bits as appropriate. However, because there is considerable variation in the data structure of the different GNSS signals, the form of the reported data also varies. This document uses the term "subframe", but other GNSS data structures might use different terms, for example, GLONASS uses "strings" and Galileo uses "pages".

## **3.15.1.1 Parsing navigation data subframes**

Each UBX-RXM-SFRBX message contains a subframe of data bits appropriate for the relevant GNSS, delivered in a number of 32-bit words, as indicated by numWords field.



Due to the variation in data structure between different GNSS, the most important step in parsing a UBX-RXM-SFRBX message is to identify the form of the data. This should be done by reading the gnssId field, which indicates which GNSS the data was decoded from. In almost all cases, this is sufficient to indicate the structure. Because of this, the following sections are organized by GNSS. However, in some cases the identity of the GNSS is not sufficient, and this is described, where appropriate, in the following sections.

In most cases, the data does not map perfectly into a number of 32-bit words and, consequently, some of the words reported in UBX-RXM-SFRBX messages contain fields marked as "Pad". These fields should be ignored and no assumption should be made about their contents.

UBX-RXM-SFRBX messages are only generated when complete subframes are detected by the receiver and all appropriate parity checks have passed.

Where the parity checking algorithm requires data to be inverted before it is decoded (e.g. GPS L1C/A), the receiver carries this out before the message output. Therefore, users can process data directly and do not need to worry about repeating any parity processing.

The meaning of the content of each subframe depends on the sending GNSS and is described in the relevant interface control documents (ICD).

## **3.15.1.2 GPS**

The data message structure in the GPS L1C/A (LNAV) and L2C/L5 (CNAV) signals is different and thus the UBX-RXM-SFRBX message structure differs as well. For the GPS L1C/A and L2C/L5 signals it is as follows:

#### **3.15.1.2.1 GPS L1C/A**

For GPS L1C/A signals, there is a fairly straightforward mapping between the reported subframe and the structure of subframe and words described in the GPS ICD. Each subframe comprises ten data words, which are reported in the same order they are received.

Each word is arranged as follows:



#### **Figure 28: GPS L1C/A subframe word**

#### **3.15.1.2.2 GPS L2C**

For GPS L2C signals each reported subframe contains the CNAV message as described in the GPS ICD. The ten words are arranged as follows:





#### **Figure 29: GPS L2C subframe words**

## **3.15.1.3 GLONASS**

For GLONASS L1OF signal, the UBX-RXM-SFRBX message contains a string content within the frame structure as described in the GLONASS ICD. This string comprises 85 data bits which are reported over three 32-bit words in the message. Data bits 1 to 8 are always a hamming code, while bits 81 to 84 are a string number and bit 85 is the idle chip, which should always have a value of zero. The meaning of other bits varies with string and frame number.

The fourth and final 32-bit word in the UBX-RXM-SFRBX message contains frame and superframe numbers (where available). These values are not actually transmitted by the satellites, but are deduced by the receiver and are included to aid decoding of the transmitted data. However, the receiver does not always know these values, in which case a value of zero is reported.

The four words are arranged as follows:





#### **Figure 30: GLONASS navigation message data**

In some circumstances, (especially on startup) the receiver may be able to decode data from a GLONASS satellite before it can identify it. When this occurs UBX-RXM-SFRBX messages will be issued with an svId of 255 to indicate "unknown".

## **3.15.1.4 BeiDou**

For BeiDou signals there is a fairly straightforward mapping between the reported subframe and the structure of subframe and words described in the BeiDou ICD. Each subframe comprises ten data words, which are reported in the same order they are received.

Each word is arranged as follows:

| <b>MSB</b> |               |                 | <b>LSB</b>       |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
| to<br>10   | Pad<br>2 bits | Data<br>22 bits | Parity<br>8 bits |

#### **Figure 31: BeiDou subframe word**

Note that as the BeiDou data words only comprise 30 bits, the 2 most significant bits in each word reported by UBX-RXM-SFRBX are padding and should be ignored.

#### **3.15.1.5 Galileo**

The Galileo E1-B and E5b in-phase signals transmit the I/NAV data message but in different configurations to enhance download time for dual frequency receivers. The UBX-RXM-SFRBX structure for the I/NAV message is shown below.



#### **3.15.1.5.1 Galileo E1-B**

For the Galileo E1-B signal, each reported subframe contains a pair of I/NAV pages as described in the Galileo ICD. Galileo pages can either be "Nominal" or "Alert" pages. For Galileo "Nominal" pages the eight words are arranged as follows:



**Figure 32: Galileo E1-B subframe words**



Alert pages are reported in very similar manner, but the page type bits will have value 1 and the structure of the eight words will be slightly different (as indicated by the Galileo ICD).

#### **3.15.1.5.2 Galileo E5b**

For the Galileo E5b in-phase signal data component, each reported subframe contains a pair of I/ NAV pages as described in the Galileo ICD. Galileo pages can either be "Nominal" or "Alert" pages. For Nominal pages the eight words are arranged as follows:



**Figure 33: Galileo E5b subframe words**



## **3.15.1.6 SBAS**

For SBAS (L1C/A) signals each reported subframe contains eight 32-bit data words to deliver the 250 bits transmitted in each SBAS data block.

The eight words are arranged as follows:



#### **Figure 34: SBAS subframe words**

## **3.15.1.7 QZSS**

The structure of the data delivered by QZSS L1C/A signals is effectively identical to that of GPS (L1C/A). Similarly the structure of the data delivered by the QZSS L2C signal is effectively identical to that of GPS (L2C).

## **3.15.1.8 Summary**

The following table gives a summary of the different data message formats reported by the UBX-RXM-SFRBX message:

# <span id="page-89-0"></span>**3.16 Forcing a receiver reset**

Typically, in GNSS receivers, a distinction is made between cold, warm, and hot start, depending on the type of valid information the receiver has at the time of the restart.

- **Cold start:** In cold start mode, the receiver has no information from the last position (e.g. time, velocity, frequency etc.) at startup. Therefore, the receiver must search the full time and frequency space, and all possible satellite numbers. If a satellite signal is found, it is tracked to decode the ephemeris (18-36 seconds under strong signal conditions), whereas the other channels continue to search satellites. Once there is a sufficient number of satellites with valid ephemeris, the receiver can calculate position and velocity data. Other GNSS receiver manufacturers call this startup mode **Factory startup**.
- **Warm start:** In warm start mode, the receiver has approximate information for time, position, and coarse satellite position data (Almanac). In this mode, after power-up, the receiver normally needs to download ephemeris before it can calculate position and velocity data. As the ephemeris data usually is outdated after 4 hours, the receiver will typically start with a warm start if it has been powered down for more than 4 hours. In this scenario, several augmentations are possible. See Multiple GNSS [assistance.](#page-68-1)
- **Hot start:** In hot start mode, the receiver was powered down only for a short time (4 hours or less), so that its ephemeris is still valid. Since the receiver does not need to download ephemeris again, this is the fastest startup method.

Using the UBX-CFG-RST message, you can force the receiver to reset and clear data, in order to see the effects of maintaining/losing such data between restarts. For this, the UBX-CFG-RST message offers the navBbrMask field, where hot, warm and cold starts can be initiated, and also other combinations thereof.

The reset type can also be specified.This is not related to GNSS, but to the way the software restarts the system.

- **Hardware reset** uses the on-chip watchdog, to electrically reset the chip. This is an immediate, asynchronous reset. No Stop event is generated.
- **Controlled software reset** terminates all running processes in an orderly manner and, once the system is idle, restarts operation, reloads its configuration and starts to acquire and track GNSS satellites.
- **Controlled software reset (GNSS only)** only restarts the GNSS tasks, without reinitializing the full system or reloading any stored configuration.
- **Hardware reset (after shutdown)** uses the on-chip watchdog. This is a reset after shutdown.
- **Controlled GNSS stop** stops all GNSS tasks. The receiver will not be restarted, but will stop any GNSS-related processing.
- **Controlled GNSS start** starts all GNSS tasks.

# <span id="page-89-1"></span>**3.17 Firmware upload**

ZED-F9R is supplied with firmware. u-blox may release updated images containing, for example, security fixes, enhancements, bug fixes, etc. Therefore it is important that customers implement a firmware update mechanism in their system.

A firmware image is a binary file containing the software to be run by the GNSS receiver. A firmware update is the process of transferring a firmware image to the receiver and storing it in non-volatile flash memory.

**Table 33: ZED-F9R pin assignment**

## <span id="page-93-0"></span>**4.2 Power supply**

The u-blox ZED-F9R module has three power supply pins: VCC, V\_BCKP and V\_USB.

## <span id="page-93-1"></span>**4.2.1 VCC: Main supply voltage**

The **VCC** pin is connected to the main supply voltage. During operation, the current drawn by the module can vary by some orders of magnitude. For this reason, it is important that the supply circuitry be able to support the peak power for a short time (see the applicable data sheet [\[1](#page-125-2)] for specification).

The module integrates a DC/DC converter, which allows reduced power consumption.

When switching from backup mode to normal operation or at startup, u-blox ZED-F9R modules must charge the internal capacitors in the core domain. In certain situations, this can result in a significant current draw. For low-power applications using backup mode, it is important that the power supply or low ESR capacitors at the module input can deliver this current/charge.

- To reduce peak current during power on, users can employ an LDO that has a built-in current limiter.
- Do not add any series resistance greater than 0.2 Î© to the VCC supply as it will generate input voltage noise due to dynamic current conditions.
- For the ZED-F9R module the equipment must be supplied by an external limited power source in compliance with the clause 2.5 of the standard IEC 60950-1.

## <span id="page-93-2"></span>**4.2.2 V\_BCKP: Backup supply voltage**

The V\_BCKP pin can be used to provide power to maintain the real-time clock (RTC) and batterybacked RAM (BBR) when VCC is removed.

V\_BCKP can be provided with a battery. If V\_BCKP is provided during a VCC outage, the receiver may be able to perform a hot or warm start. Especially if the RTC and BBR contents are still current, for example, after a short VCC outage. The fusion filter data is also stored in BBR and ZED-F9R can restart in fusion mode.

If V\_BCKP is not provided, the module performs a cold start at power up. Also sensors will need to be recalibrated.

If a host is connected to ZED-F9R, V\_BCKP can be partially emulated by using UBX-UPD-SOS functionality. BBR data can saved to the host and restored at startup. See the applicable [Interface](#page-125-1) [description](#page-125-1) for more information.

- Avoid high resistance on the **V\_BCKP** line: During the switch from main supply to backup supply, a short current adjustment peak can cause a high voltage drop on the pin with possible malfunctions.
- If no backup supply voltage is available, connect the **V\_BCKP** pin to **VCC**.
- Allow all I/O including UART and other interfaces to float or connect to a high impedance in HW backup mode (V\_BCKP supplied when VCC is removed). See the [Interfaces](#page-63-0) section.

## **Real-time clock (RTC)**



The real-time clock (RTC) is driven by a 32-kHz oscillator using an RTC crystal. If VCC is removed while a battery is connected to **V\_BCKP**, most of the receiver is switched off leaving the RTC and BBR powered. This operating mode is called Hardware Backup Mode which enables time keeping and all relevant data to be saved to allow a hot or warm start.

## <span id="page-94-0"></span>**4.2.3 ZED-F9R power supply**

The ZED-F9R requires a low-noise, low-dropout voltage, and a very low source impedance power supply of 3.3 V typically. No inductors or ferrite beads should be used from LDO to the module VCC pin. The peak currents need to be taken into account for the source supplying the LDO for the module.

A power supply fed by 5 V is shown in the figure below. This example circuit is intended only for the module supply.



**Figure 36: ZED-F9R power supply**

# <span id="page-94-1"></span>**4.3 ZED-F9R minimal design**

The minimal electrical circuit for ZED-F9R operation using the UART1 interface is shown in [Figure](#page-95-1) [37](#page-95-1) below.



<span id="page-95-1"></span>

#### **Figure 37: Minimal ZED-F9R design**

For a minimal design with the ZED-F9R GNSS modules, the following functions and pins should be considered:

- Connect the power supply to VCC and V\_BCKP.
- If hot or warm start operations are needed, connect a backup battery to V\_BCKP.
- If USB is not used connect V\_USB to ground.
- Ensure an optimal ground connection to all ground pins of the ZED-F9R GNSS module.

The host interface typically supplies the RTCM messages required for RTK operation.

# <span id="page-96-0"></span>**4.5 Antenna**

The ZED-F9R requires an active antenna with an integrated LNA to ensure good performance under nominal signal reception.

When implementing a custom antenna installation, it is recommended that an OEM active antenna module be used that meets our specification. Implementing a custom active antenna design is an important exercise to meet the required bandwidths and group delay specifications compared to previous L1-only designs.

A typical dual band antenna design block diagram is shown below taken from the u-blox ANN-MB active antenna product.



**Figure 39: u-blox low cost dual-band antenna internal structure**

A suitable ground plane is required for the antenna to achieve good performance.



Location of the antenna is critical to reach the stated performance. Unsuitable locations within a vehicle could include, under vehicle dash, rear-view mirror location, etc.

It is recommended to mount the antenna on the roof top of the car or a location unobstructed by the user.

- Buffers U3, U7 and U8 are optional depending on the application.They are not needed if the VCC\_RF pin is used.
- An open drain buffer is recommended in case the antenna is supplied while the module is not, since IO pins must not be driven. If the antenna operates at a higher voltage like 5 V or 12 V, use of the buffer is also recommended.



# <span id="page-102-0"></span>**4.6 EOS/ESD precautions**

- To avoid overstress damage during production or in the field it is essential to observe strict EOS/ ESD/EMI handling and protection measures.
- To prevent overstress damage at the RF\_IN of your receiver, never exceed the maximum input power as specified in the applicable Data sheet [\[1\]](#page-125-2).

When integrating GNSS receivers into wireless systems, pay special attention to electromagnetic and voltage susceptibility issues. Wireless systems include components which can produce Electrostatic Discharge (ESD), Electrical Overstress (EOS) and Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI). CMOS devices are more sensitive to such influences because their failure mechanism is defined by the applied voltage, whereas bipolar semiconductors are more susceptible to thermal overstress. The following design guidelines help in designing robust yet cost-effective solutions.

## <span id="page-102-1"></span>**4.6.1 ESD protection measures**

GNSS receivers are sensitive to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD). Special precautions are required when handling. Most defects caused by ESD can be prevented by following strict ESD protection rules for production and handling. When implementing passive antenna patches or external antenna connection points, then additional ESD measures as shown in the figure below can also avoid failures in the field.





## <span id="page-102-2"></span>**4.6.2 EOS precautions**

Electrical overstress (EOS) usually describes situations when the maximum input power exceeds the maximum specified ratings. EOS failure can happen if RF emitters are close to a GNSS receiver or its antenna. EOS causes damage to the chip structures. If the RF\_IN is damaged by EOS, it is hard to determine whether the chip structures have been damaged by ESD or EOS.

EOS protection measures as shown in the figure below are recommended for any designs combining wireless communication transceivers (e.g. GSM, GPRS) and GNSS in the same design or in close proximity.





**Figure 46: Active antenna EOS protection**

## <span id="page-103-0"></span>**4.6.3 Safety precautions**

The ZED-F9R must be supplied by an external limited power source in compliance with the clause 2.5 of the standard IEC 60950-1. In addition to external limited power source, only Separated or Safety Extra-Low Voltage (SELV) circuits are to be connected to the module including interfaces and antennas.

For more information about SELV circuits see section 2.2 in Safety standard IEC 60950-1.

# <span id="page-103-1"></span>**4.7 Electromagnetic interference on I/O lines**

Any I/O signal line with a length greater than approximately 3 mm can act as an antenna and may pick up arbitrary RF signals transferring them as noise into the receiver. This specifically applies to unshielded lines, in which the corresponding GND layer is remote or missing entirely, and lines close to the edges of the printed circuit board.

If, for example, a cellular signal radiates into an unshielded high-impedance line, it is possible to generate noise in the order of volts and not only distort receiver operation but also damage it permanently. Another type of interference can be caused by noise generated at the PIO pins that emits from unshielded I/O lines. Receiver performance may be degraded when this noise is coupled into the GNSS antenna.

EMI protection measures are particularly useful when RF emitting devices are placed next to the GNSS receiver and/or to minimize the risk of EMI degradation due to self-jamming. An adequate layout with a robust grounding concept is essential in order to protect against EMI.

Intended Use: Inorder tomitigate any performance degradationof a radio equipment underEMC disturbance, system integration shall adopt appropriate EMC design practice and not contain cables over three meters on signal and supply ports.

## <span id="page-103-2"></span>**4.7.1 General notes on interference issues**

Received GNSSsignalpower at the antenna is very low. At thenominal receivedsignal strength(-128 dBm) it is below the thermal noise floor of -111 dBm. Due to this fact, a GNSS receiver is susceptible to interference from nearby RF sources of any kind. Two cases can be distinguished:

â¢ Out-of-band interference: Typically any kind of wireless communications system (e.g. LTE, GSM, CDMA, 3G, WLAN, Bluetooth, etc.) may emit its specified maximum transmit power in close proximity to the GNSS receiving antenna, especially if such a system is integrated with the GNSS receiver. Even at reasonable antenna selectivity, destructive power levels may reach the RF input of the GNSS receiver. Also, larger signal interferers may generate intermodulation products inside the GNSS receiver front-end that fall into the GNSS band and contribute to inband interference.



â¢ In-band interference: Although the GNSS band is kept free from intentional RF signal sources by radio-communications standards, many devices emit RF power into the GNSS band at levels much higher than the GNSS signal itself. One reason is that the frequency band above 1 GHz is not well regulated with regards to EMI, and even if permitted, signal levels are much higher than GNSS signal power. Notably, all types of digital equipment, such as PCs, digital cameras, LCD screens, etc. tend to emit a broad frequency spectrum up to several GHz of frequency. Also wireless transmitters may generate spurious emissions that fall into GNSS band.

As an example, GSM uses power levels of up to 2 W (+33 dBm). The absolute maximum power input at the RF input of the GNSS receiver can be +15 dBm. The GSM specification allows spurious emissions for GSM transmitters of up to +36 dBm, while the GNSS signal is less than -128 dBm. By simply comparing these numbers it is obvious that interference issues must be seriously considered in any design of a GNSS receiver. Different design goals may be achieved through different implementations:

- The primary focus is to prevent damaging the receiver from large input signals. Here the GNSS performance under interference conditions is not important and suppression of the signal is permitted. It is sufficient to just observe the maximum RF power ratings of all of the components in the RF input path.
- GNSS performance must be guaranteed even under interference conditions. In such a case, not only the maximum power ratings of the components in the receiver RF path must be observed. Further, non-linear effects like gain compression, NF degradation (desensitization) and intermodulation must be analyzed.
- Pulsed interference with a low-duty cycle such as GSM may be destructive due to the high peak power levels.

## <span id="page-104-0"></span>**4.7.2 In-band interference mitigation**

With in-band interference, the signal frequency is very close to the GNSS frequency. Such interference signals are typically caused by harmonics fromdisplays,micro-controller operation, bus systems, etc. Measures against in-band interference include:

- Maintaining a good grounding concept in the design
- Shielding
- Layout optimization
- Low-pass filtering of noise sources, e.g. digital signal lines
- Remote placement of the GNSS antenna, far away from noise sources
- Adding an LTE, CDMA, GSM, WCDMA, BT band-pass filter before antenna

## <span id="page-104-1"></span>**4.7.3 Out-of-band interference**

Out-of-band interference is caused by signal frequencies that are different from the GNSS carrier frequency. The main sources are wireless communication systems such as LTE, GSM, CDMA, WCDMA, Wi-Fi, BT, etc.

Measures against out-of-band interference include maintaining a good grounding concept in the design and adding a GNSS band-pass filter into the antenna input line to the receiver.

For GSM applications, such as typical handset design, an isolation of approximately 20 dB can be reached with careful placement of the antennas. If this is insufficient, an additional SAW filter is required on the GNSS receiver input to block the remaining GSM transmitter energy.



# <span id="page-105-0"></span>**4.8 Layout**

This section details layout and placement requirements of the ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver.

## <span id="page-105-1"></span>**4.8.1 Placement**

GNSS signals at the surface of the Earth are below the thermal noise floor. A very important factor in achieving maximum GNSS performance is the placement of the receiver on the PCB. The placement used may affect RF signal loss from antenna to receiver input and enable interference into the sensitive parts of the receiver chain, including the antenna itself. When defining a GNSS receiver layout, the placement of the antenna with respect to the receiver, as well as grounding, shielding and interference from other digital devices are crucial issues and need to be considered very carefully.

Signal loss on the RF connection from antenna to receiver input must be minimized as much as possible. Hence, the connection to the antenna must be kept as short as possible.

Ensure that RF critical circuits are clearly separated from any other digital circuits on the system board. To achieve this, position digital part of the receiver close to the digital section of the system PCB and place the RF section and antenna as far away from the other digital circuits on the board as possible.

A proper GND concept shall be followed: the RF section shall not be subject to noisy digital supply currents running through its GND plane.

## <span id="page-105-2"></span>**4.8.2 Thermal and mechanical considerations**

Temperature-sensitive components, such as TCXOs and crystals, are highly susceptible to sudden changes in ambient temperature, which can negatively impact the GNSS signal tracking. Additionally, mechanical stress and vibration can further degrade performance. For best practices on thermal and mechanical design to enhance GNSS stability and accuracy, and ensure reliable performance in challenging conditions, refer to [Table](#page-105-4) 40.

## <span id="page-107-0"></span>**4.8.4 Layout guidance**

The presented layout guidance reduces the risk of performance issues at design level.

#### **4.8.4.1 RF In trace**

The RF in trace has to work in the combined GNSS signal bands.

For FR-4 PCB material with a dielectric permittivity of for example 4.7, the trace width for the 50 Î© line impedance can be calculated.



A grounded co-planar RF trace is recommended as it provides the maximum shielding from noise with adequate vias to the ground layer.

The RF trace must be shielded by vias to ground along the entire length of the trace and the ZED-F9R RF\_IN pad should be surrounded by vias as shown in the figure below.



**Figure 49: RF input trace**

The RF\_IN trace on the top layer should be referenced to a suitable ground layer.

## **4.8.4.2 Vias for the ground pads**

The ground pads under the ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver need to be grounded with vias to the lower ground layer of the PCB. A solid ground layer fill on the top layer of the PCB is recommended. This is shown in the figure below.



**Figure 50: Top layer fill and vias**

## **4.8.4.3 VCC pads**

The VCC pads for the ZED-F9R high precision sensor fusion receiver must have as low impedance as possible with large vias to the lower power layer of the PCB. The VCC pads need a large combined



pad and the de-coupling capacitors must be placed as close as possible. This is shown in the figure below.



**Figure 51: VCC pads**

# <span id="page-109-0"></span>**4.9 Design guidance**

## <span id="page-109-1"></span>**4.9.1 General considerations**

Check power supply requirements and schematic:

- Is the power supply voltage within the specified range and noise-free?
- If USB is not used, connect the V\_USB pin to ground.
- It is recommended to have a separate LDO for V\_USB that is enabled by the module VCC. This is to comply with the USB self-powered specification.
- If USB is used, is there a 1 uF capacitor right near the V\_USB pin? This is just for the V\_USB pin.
- Is there a 1 uF cap right next to the module VCC pin?
- Compare the peak current consumption of the ZED-F9R GNSS module with the specification of your power supply.
- GNSS receivers require a stable power supply. Avoid series resistance (less than 0.2 Î©) in your power supply line (the line to VCC) to minimize the voltage ripple on VCC. See the ZED-F9R Power [supply](#page-93-0) section in the [Design](#page-91-0) chapter for more information on the power supply requirements.
- Allow all I/O to Float/High impedance (High-Z) when VCC is not applied.

## <span id="page-109-2"></span>**4.9.2 Backup battery**

Check backup supply requirements and schematic:

- For achieving a minimal time to first fix (TTFF) after a power down (warm starts, hot starts), make sure to connect a backup battery to V\_BCKP.
- Verify that your battery backup supply can provide the battery backup current specified in the applicable data sheet.
- Allow all I/O including UART and other interfaces to Float/High impedance in HW backup mode (battery backup connected with VCC removed).

## <span id="page-109-3"></span>**4.9.3 RF front-end circuit options**

It is important that the RF input is fed by an active antenna meeting the requirements for the ZED-F9R.

The first stages of the signal processing chain are crucial to the overall receiver performance.



When an RF input connector is employed this can provide a conduction path for harmful or destructive electrical signals. If this is a likely factor the RF input should be protected accordingly.

## **Additional points on the RF input**

- What is the expected quality of the signal source (antenna)?
- What is the external active antenna signal power?
- What is the bandwidth and filtering of the external active antenna?
- Does the external antenna and filtering components meet the group delay variation requirements? This is critical for high accuracy applications such as RTK and timing.

Are destructive RF power levels expected to reach the RF input? Is interference from wireless transmitters expected?

- What are the characteristics of these signals (duty cycle, frequency range, power range, spectral purity)?
- What is the expected GNSS performance under interference conditions?

Is there a risk of RF input exposure to excessive ESD stress?

- In the field: Can the user access the antenna connector?
- PCB / system assembly: Is there risk that statically charged parts (e.g. patch antennas) may be discharged through the RF input?

The following subsections provide several options addressing the various questions above:

- In some applications, such as cellular transceivers, interference signals may exceed the maximum power rating of the RF\_IN input. To avoid device destruction use of external input protection is mandatory.
- During assembly of end-user devices which contain passive patch antennas, an ESD discharge may occur during production when pre-charged antennas are soldered to the GNSS receiver board. In such cases, use of external protection in front of RF\_IN is mandatory to avoid device destruction.

ESD discharge cannot be avoided during assembly and / or field use. Note that SAW filters are susceptible to ESD damage. To provide additional robustness an ESD protection diode may be placed at the antenna RF connector to GND.

## <span id="page-110-0"></span>**4.9.4 Antenna/RF input**

Check RF input requirements and schematic:

- An OEM active antenna module that meets our requirements should be used if there is a need to integrate the antenna.
- The total maximum noise figure including external LNA (or the LNA in the active antenna) should be around 3 dB.
- Ensure active antenna gain is ideally between 30 40 dB gain.
- Make sure the antenna is not placed close to noisy parts of the circuitry and does not face any other noisy elements (for example microcontroller, display).
- Signal levels above 40 C/N0 average are required for optimal RTK performance.
- If a patch type antenna is used, an antenna ground plane with minimum 100 150 mm diameter is required.
- Ensure antenna supports both L1 and L2 bands.
- Ensure antenna element gain is between 2 and 3 dBic typical for each band.
- Ensure the group delay variation including active antenna is 10 ns max at each GNSS system bandwidth. Note: Inter-signal requirement 50 ns max.
- ESD protection on the RF input is mandatory.



- A Bias-t inductor must be selected with high impedance in the GNSS bands.
- Ensure RF trace is tuned for 50 Î© to ensure adequate bandwidth and power matching.

## <span id="page-111-0"></span>**4.9.5 Ground pads**

Ensure the ground pads of the module are connected to ground.

## <span id="page-111-1"></span>**4.9.6 Schematic design**

For a **minimal design** with the ZED-F9R GNSS modules, consider the following functions and pins:

- Connect the power supply to VCC and V\_BCKP.
- V\_USB: If USB is used it is recommended V\_USB is to be powered as per USB self-powered mode specification.
- If USB is not used connect V\_USB to ground.
- Ensure an optimal ground connection to all ground pins of the ZED-F9R GNSS module.
- Choose the required serial communication interfaces (UART, USB, SPI or I2C) and connect the appropriate pins to your application.
- If you need hot or warm start in your application, connect a backup battery to V\_BCKP.

## <span id="page-111-2"></span>**4.9.7 Layout design-in guideline**

- Is the receiver placed away from heat sources?
- Is the receiver placed away from air-cooling sources?
- Is the receiver shielded by a cover/case to prevent the effects of air currents and rapid environmental temperature changes?
- Is the receiver placed as recommended in the [Layout](#page-105-0) and Layout [guidance](#page-107-0)?
- Assure a low serial resistance on the VCC power supply line (choose a line width > 400 um).
- Keep the power supply line as short as possible.
- Add a ground plane underneath the module to reduce interference. This is especially important for the RF input line.
- For improved shielding, add as many vias as possible around the micro strip/co-planar waveguide, around the serial communication lines, underneath the module, etc.



# <span id="page-112-0"></span>**5 Product handling**

# <span id="page-112-1"></span>**5.1 ESD handling precautions**

CAUTION! Risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage. u-blox chips and modules are electrostatic sensitive devices containing highly sensitive electronic circuitry. A discharge of static electricity may damage the device or reduce the life expectancy of the device. To avoid ESD damage, adhere to the standard guidelines for handling ESD devices.

Consider the following:

## **Preventing electrostatic discharge**

- Keep components in their original packages during transport.
- Open the package within an ESD-protected area (EPA), as in [Figure](#page-113-1) 52.
- At a workstation, store components in an EPA.
- PlaceESD sensitive devices inside of shielding packaging or containers when transported outside of an EPA.
- Use protective clothing and proper personnel grounding at all necessary points when touching electrostatic sensitive device or assembly. For instance, wear ESD-safe clothing and shoes and wear an ESD wrist strap connected to a grounded workstation. Use heel straps when standing on conductive floors or dissipating floor mats.
- Hold the devices by the edges and avoid touching component contacts, pins, or circuitry

## **Product handling**

- When handling RF transceivers and patch antennas, work in an EPA.
- When connecting test equipment or any other electronics to the module (as a standalone or PCBmounted device), the first point of contact must always be between the local ground and the PCB ground.
- Before mounting a ceramic patch antenna, connect the device to ground.
- When handling the RF pin, do not touch any charged capacitors. Be especially careful when handling materials like patch antennas (~10 pF), coaxial cables (~50-80 pF/m), soldering irons, or any other materials that can develop charges.
- If there is any risk of touching an exposed antenna area in a non-ESD protected work area, implement proper ESD protection measures in the design.
- When soldering RF connectors and patch antennas to the receiver's RF pin, use an ESD-safe soldering iron (tip)



<span id="page-113-1"></span>



# <span id="page-113-0"></span>**5.2 Soldering**

## **Soldering paste**

Use of "no clean" soldering paste is highly recommended, as it does not require cleaning after the soldering process. For instance, the paste in the example below meets these criteria.

- Soldering paste: OM338 SAC405 / Nr.143714 (Cookson Electronics)
- Alloy specification: Sn 95.5/ Ag 4/ Cu 0.5 (95.5% tin/ 4% silver/ 0.5% copper)
- Melting temperature: 217 Â°C
- Stencil thickness: The exact geometry, distances, stencil thicknesses and solder paste volumes must be adapted to the customer's specific production processes (e.g. soldering).

## **Reflow soldering**

CAUTION. Risk of device damage. Exceeding the peak temperature of the recommended soldering profile may permanently damage the device.

The final soldering temperature chosen at the factory depends on additional external factors such as the choice of soldering paste, size, thickness and properties of the base board, etc.

CAUTION. Risk of device damage. Modules must not be soldered with a damp heat process.

As a reference, see "IPC-7530 Guidelines for temperature profiling for mass soldering (reflow and wave) processes", published in 2001.

A convection-type soldering oven is highly recommended over the infrared-type radiation oven. Convection-heated ovens allow precise control of the temperature, and all parts will heat up evenly, regardless of material properties, thickness of components and surface color.

To avoid falling off, the modules should be placed on the topside of the board during soldering.

As a reference, see "IPC-7530 Guidelines for temperature profiling for mass soldering (reflow and wave) processes", published in 2001.

**Table 43: Recommended conditions for reflow soldering**

#### **Optical inspection**

After soldering the module, consider optical inspection.

#### **Cleaning**

Do not clean with water, solvent, or ultrasonic cleaner:

- Cleaning with water will lead to capillary effects where water is absorbed into the gap between the baseboard and the module. The combination of residues of soldering flux and encapsulated water leads to short circuits or resistor-like interconnections between neighboring pads.
- Cleaning with alcohol or other organic solvents can result in soldering flux residues flowing underneath the module, into areas that are not accessible for post-cleaning inspections. The solvent will also damage the sticker and the printed text.
- CAUTION. Risk of device damage. Ultrasonic cleaning permanently damages the module, in particular the quartz oscillators.

The best approach is to use a "no clean" soldering paste and eliminate the cleaning step after the soldering.

#### **Repeated reflow soldering**

Repeated reflow soldering processes or soldering the module upside down are not recommended.

A board that is populated with components on both sides may require more than one reflow soldering cycle. In such a case, the process should ensure the module is only placed on the board submitted for a single final upright reflow cycle. A module placed on the underside of the board may detach during a reflow soldering cycle due to lack of adhesion.

The module can also tolerate an additional reflow cycle for rework purposes.

#### **Wave soldering**

Base boards with combined through-hole technology (THT) components and surface-mount technology (SMT) devices require wave soldering to solder the THT components. Only a single wave soldering process is encouraged for boards populated with modules.

#### **Rework**

CAUTION. Risk of device damage. Using a hot air gun is an uncontrolled process. It can lead to overheating and severely damage the module. Always avoid overheating the module.

After the module is removed from the oven, clean the pins before reapplying the solder paste, placing the module in the oven and proceeding with the reflow soldering of a new module.

Never attempt to alter the module itself, e.g. by replacing individual components. Such actions immediately void the warranty.

#### **Conformal coating**

Certain applications employ a conformal coating of the PCB using HumiSealÂ® or other related coating products. These materials affect the RF properties of the GNSS module and it is important to prevent them from flowing into the module. The RF shields do not provide 100% protection for the module from coating liquids with low viscosity. Apply the coating carefully.



Conformal coating of the module will void the warranty.

#### **Casting**

If casting is required, use viscose or another type of silicon pottant. The OEM is strongly advised to qualify that such processes are suitable for the module before implementing them in the production.

Casting voids the warranty.

#### **Grounding metal covers**

Attempts to improve grounding by soldering ground cables, wick or other forms of metal strips directly onto the EMI covers is done at the customer's own risk. The numerous ground pins should be sufficient to provide optimum immunity to interference and noise.

u-blox provides no warranty for damages to the module caused by soldering metal cables or any other forms of metal strips directly onto the EMI covers.

## **Use of ultrasonic processes**

- CAUTION. Risk of device damage. Use of any ultrasonic processes (cleaning, welding etc.) may cause damage to the receiver.
- u-blox provides no warranty against damages to the module caused by ultrasonic processes.

# <span id="page-119-0"></span>**B Reference frames**

Real time kinematic (RTK) is a differential system where the rover uses the corrections from a reference station or a reference station network. The rover receiver will calculate its position in the reference frame used by the service provider in its correction stream. If the output is required in a different reference frame, then a (custom) datum transformation is required.

For example, if an application requires the position in the ITRF14 reference frame but the correction service is using the ETRF14 reference frame - to which the RTK solution will also be referring - then this reference frame offset needs to be compensated. For example if utilizing a truth system which is using corrections referring to different reference frame, it is important to compensate for the reference frame offset to avoid systematic errors in the analysis.

Terrestrial reference system is a coordinate reference system which is rotating in space with the rotation of the Earth. The reference system is an abstract concept that is realized by obtaining coordinates for some points on the surface of the Earth. This kind of realization is called a reference frame. For more details, see for example the ITRF [webpage](http://itrf.ensg.ign.fr/trs_trf.php). Commonly used reference systems include International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89).

Widely used reference frames include for example International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) andEuropeanTerrestrial Reference Frame (ETRF). ITRF is a realization of ITRS, done every few years. Latest realizations of ITRF are ITRF2008 and ITRF2014. ETRF is a realization of ETRS89, done every few years. Latest realizations are ITRF2005 and ETRF2014.

For example, the EUREF is used to realize the ETRS89. For information, see their homepage: [EUREF](http://www.epncb.oma.be/).

See the ITRF website for more information and an online transform calculator: [ITRF](http://itrf.ensg.ign.fr/ITRF_solutions/index.php).

Another online tool for transformations is available on the EUREF network page: [EUREF](http://www.epncb.oma.be/_productsservices/coord_trans/) [Transformation](http://www.epncb.oma.be/_productsservices/coord_trans/).

Reference frames can have constant offsets between each other but, in addition to that, they can also drift and rotate with respect to each other. One major reason for this is that the tectonic plates move constantly and the reference frames that are attached to the tectonic plates move along with the plates.

The ZED-F9R stores the EGM96 geoid model with limited resolution, leading to degraded precision of the reported mean sea level height and geoid separation. If the user application needs higher geoid separation accuracy, it is required to apply its own adjustment to the ellipsoidal height output from the ZED-F9R.

This section provides some guidance for using u-center to evaluate ZED-F9R RTK operation.

## <span id="page-119-2"></span>**C.1 Receiver configuration with u-center**

In this example, UART1 is configured to use a suitable baud rate for communicating with a host PC running u-center. A set of output messages are enabled so that the receiver status can be monitored.



Using the UBX-CFG-VALSET configuration window, set the UART1 interface for the correct host baud rate:
