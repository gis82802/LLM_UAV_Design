## **3 Description**

The u-blox ZED-F9P-15B multi-band GNSS module with high precision has reached Engineering Sample (ES) status with firmware FW100HPG L1L5 1.40.

This is the L1L5 band version of the ZED-F9P product variants. The receiver supports RTCM and SPARTN formatted augmentation services.

# **4 Schedule**

First samples are available in early September.

#### **5 Customer impact and recommended action**

- Previous versions of L1L2 can still be ordered by customers who want to use an older version and customers do not need to migrate.
- Being the first hardware and firmware variant supporting L1L5 in the ZED form factor, customers need to download the latest documentation and get samples to start new designs.
- This firmware runs only on the ZED-F9P-15B hardware and is not compatible with previous hardware variants which are L1L2.
