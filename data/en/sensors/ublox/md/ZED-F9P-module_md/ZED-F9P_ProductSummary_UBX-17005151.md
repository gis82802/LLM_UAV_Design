## **Product description**

The ZED-F9P positioning module integrates multi-band GNSS and real time kinematics (RTK) technology in a compact form factor, to deliver centimeter-level accuracies in seconds for the industrial navigation and robotics markets.

ZED-F9P concurrently uses signals from the GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, and NavIC GNSS constellations. GNSS signals from multiple frequency bands combined with RTK technology enables fast convergence times and reliable performance for scalable applications, including robotic lawnmowers, unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAV), and semi-automated or fully automated machinery.

With its high update rate and low power consumption levels, the ZED-F9P module is ideal for highly dynamic applications such as UAVs. ZED-F9P ensures the security of positioning and navigation information by using secure interfaces and advanced jamming and spoofing detection technologies, such as Galileo OSNMA. The receiver enables easy integration and helps product developers quickly bring their ideas to the market.

ZED-F9P offers support for a range of correction services allowing each application to optimize performance according to the application's unique set of needs. ZED-F9P comes with built-in support for standard RTCM corrections, supporting centimeter-level navigation from local base stations or from virtual reference stations (VRS) in a Network RTK setup. The module supports SPARTN format SSR-type correction services suitable for mass market applications.

u-blox modules are manufactured in ISO/TS 16949 certified sites and are fully tested on a system level. Qualification tests are performed as stipulated in the ISO16750 standard: "Road vehicles – Environmental conditions and testing for electrical and electronic equipment".
