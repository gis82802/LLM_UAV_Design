#### **3 Description**

The u-blox ZED-F9P-05B multi-band GNSS module with high precision has reached Engineering Sample (ES) status with firmware FW100HPG1.50.

The major feature is Galileo OSNMA for spoofing detection. The receiver supports RTCM and SPARTN formatted augmentation services.

### **4 Schedule**

First samples are available in early August.

#### **5 Customer impact and recommended action**

- Previous versions of L1L2 can still be ordered by customers who want to use an older version but are encouraged to migrate. Please consult datasheet for performance figures.
- This firmware runs only on the ZED-F9P-05B hardware and is compatible with previous hardware variants which are L1L2. It is not compatible with hardware supporting L1/L5 bands such as NEO-F9P-15B or ZED-F9P-15B.
