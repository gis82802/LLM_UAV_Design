## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**1 Introduction**

#### <span id="page-4-1"></span>**1.1 Purpose and scope**

This document provides general information about how u-blox mass-production products, including GNSS and short-range modules, chips, and antennas, are packed for delivery to customers. This information supplements that provided in the data sheets and integration manuals, which include the specifications of the reel types used for the distribution of each specific product. The packaging information provided in this guide is not applicable to sample volumes.

#### <span id="page-4-2"></span>**1.2 Packing hierarchy**

The packaging for each product depends on whether it is delivered on reels or trays. u-blox modules are delivered on either tape or tray, but u-blox chips are shipped exclusively on tape. See also [Tape](#page-5-1)  [reels](#page-5-1) and [Shipping parcels for trays or compartments.](#page-19-0)

The packing order for chips and modules delivered on tape reels is shown from left to right in [Table 1.](#page-4-3)



<span id="page-4-3"></span>**Table 1: Packing hierarchy of u-blox chips and modules delivered on tape reels**

The packing order for u-blox modules delivered on trays is shown from left to right i[n](#page-4-4)

[Table](#page-4-4) **2.**



<span id="page-4-4"></span>**Table 2: Packing hierarchy of u-blox modules that are delivered on trays**

### <span id="page-5-0"></span>**2 Shipping chips and modules**

u-blox chips and modules are delivered as reeled tapes (see [Figure 1\)](#page-5-2) or on trays [\(Figure 2\)](#page-5-3), which enables efficient production, production lot set-up and tear-down. Products with moisture sensitivity level (MSL) rating of 2 or above are shipped in a hermetically sealed package known as a "dry bag" (see [Moisture sensitivity\)](#page-5-1) to prevent moisture intake and to protect against electrostatic discharge. Reels for products with an MSL rating of 1 are shipped in a special shielding bag. For protection from physical damage, the reels are individually packed in cartons. See also [Packing reels in cartons.](#page-13-0)

Products that are normally delivered on a reel WILL NOT be delivered on a reel if the order volume is less than that specified in the specific data sheet or integration manual for the product. See also [Packing hierarchy.](#page-4-2) [Contact](#page-38-0) u-blox Sales Administration for any related questions prior to placing a partial order.





**Figure 1: Tape reel Figure 2: Tray**

<span id="page-5-3"></span>

#### <span id="page-5-2"></span><span id="page-5-1"></span>**2.1 Tape reels**

Most u-blox chips and modules that are delivered on tape come on reel type A, B, C or D. The reel type for each specific product is described in the respective data sheet.

**☞** Product orders for volumes less than order quantities specified in the product data sheet or integration manual must be requested specifically in the purchase order. The number of pieces on a single reel of tape varies between products but is defined in the respective product data sheet. [Contact](#page-38-0) u-blox Sales Administration with any related questions prior to placing your order. See also [Shipping of non-standard quantities.](#page-28-0)

[Figure 3](#page-6-0) to [Figure 10](#page-6-1) show the various reel types on which u-blox chips and modules are shipped.

<span id="page-6-2"></span>**Figure 11: Elements of the reel**

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>**Reel type A**

Type A reels are composed of two flanges, with the width between the flanges determined by the width of the hub that forms the winding surface for the tape.

Type A reels are used for standard UBX family chipsets and modules and come in different widths to accommodate the different chip sizes and subsequent tape width[. Table 3](#page-7-1) lists the possible variants and widths of the flange combinations.

| Width variants | Tape width | Flange width combination |
|----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| Type A1        | 12 mm      | 4 mm + 8 mm              |
| Type A2        | 16 mm      | 8 mm + 8 mm              |
| Type A3        | 24 mm      | 8 mm + 16 mm             |
| Type A4        | 32 mm      | 16 mm + 16 mm            |
| Type A5        | 44 mm      | 28 mm + 16 mm            |

#### <span id="page-13-0"></span>**2.2 Packing reels in cartons**

u-blox delivers the reels of chips and modules in several packing carton types (A-G), as described in the following sections. The physical dimensions of each carton type vary.

The type of packing carton used for shipping mass-production products is determined by the type of tape and reel on which the chip or module is delivered.

A packing carton is sometimes referred to as a "pizza box".

Although parcels generally include reels of the same type, parcels in "split shipments" can contain different reel types. [Table 13](#page-18-1) describes the possible reel types and maximum number of cartons for different sized parcels in split shipments.

| Parcel dimensions mm | Reel types | Maximum number of reel cartons |
|----------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| 260 x 270 x 150      | B, D, F    | 2                              |
| 380 x 360 x 220      | A, C, E    | 4                              |
| 380 x 380 x 300      | A, C E     | 5                              |
| 260 x 270 x 350      | B, D, F    | 5                              |
| 520 x 350 x 270      | B, D, F    | 10                             |
| 590 x 390 x 390      | A, C, E    | 10                             |

#### <span id="page-19-0"></span>**2.5 Shipping parcels for trays or compartments**

Trays are normally used for shipping products that, due to their size or their connectors, do not fit well on tapes. The trays come in various sizes and provide the necessary protection for the products to be packed directly in the shipping parcels. Tray specifications are given in the product documentation.

#### <span id="page-19-1"></span>**Shipping parcel 333 x 203 x 144 mm**

A shipping parcel with dimensions 333 x 203 x 144 mm is used to pack products in trays of 330 x 200 mm, where each tray holds 20 cards. The parcel holds ten full trays plus one empty tray (to protect the top layer of products), for a total of 200 pieces. This is typically used for M2-cards for Positioning.



**Figure 35: 333 x 203 x 144 mm shipping parcel with each tray holding 20 cards**

[Figure 36](#page-20-1) shows the dimensions of stacked trays – with and without an extra tray that is included as an extra cushion against potential physical damage during shipment.

<span id="page-20-1"></span>**Figure 36: Dimensions for stacked trays** 

#### <span id="page-20-0"></span>**Shipping parcel 360 x 220 x 380 mm**

360 x 220 x 380 mm shipping parcels typically pack modules in trays of 16 pieces, with 10 trays in a 220 x 180 x 340 mm package (160 units in total).



**Figure 37: 360 x 220 x 380 mm shipping parcel with 16-piece trays for 160 units**

#### <span id="page-21-0"></span>**Shipping parcel 390 x 270 x 100 mm**

Some boards, like the RCB-F9T, are delivered in a special 390 x 270 x 100 mm parcel with 72 (8 x 9) individual compartments. Boards packed in these parcels are each in their own antistatic, plastic bag.



**Figure 38: Special 390 x 270 x 100 shipping parcel with individual compartments**

#### <span id="page-21-1"></span>**Shipping parcel 229 x 324 x 60 mm**

M2 cards for short range products, like M2-JODY-W263, which use trays of 28 pieces each are delivered in 229 x 324 x 60 mm inner boxes. One inner box contains five stacked trays of 140 pieces in total. The trays are sealed in vacuum bags including desiccant bags and humidity indicators. Outer box size may vary depending on volume shipped.



**Figure 39: Packed tray, sealed tray and closed inner box for M2 cards**

#### <span id="page-21-2"></span>**Shipping parcel 345 x 345 x 70 mm**

ANT-B10-00C antenna boards are delivered in 345 x 345 x 70 mm inner boxes. Boxes include trays of 4 pieces each. One inner box contains 3 stacked trays, totaling 12 pieces. An empty tray is used on top as a cover. The trays are sealed in vacuum bags including a desiccant bag.

### <span id="page-22-0"></span>**2.6 Shipping labels**

For shipping, u-blox provides batch and multipack labels for packages containing larger volumes of products, as well as moisture sensitive device (MSD) labeling where necessary. See also [Storage.](#page-29-4) Batch labels are affixed to reels, sealed bags, and individual packing cartons. MSD labels are affixed to sealed bags, and multipack labels are affixed to shipping parcels.

[Table 14](#page-22-2) shows the hierarchy of u-blox shipping labels and where they are affixed. For individual product labeling information, see the applicable data sheet.

|                 | Batch label | MSD label | Multipack label |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Reel            | X           |           |                 |
| Sealed bag      | X           | X         |                 |
| Packing carton  | X           |           |                 |
| Shipping parcel |             |           | X               |

<span id="page-22-2"></span>**Table 14: Label hierarchy**

[Figure 42](#page-22-3) shows an example of the location of the batch label on a sealed reel and the packing carton; the MSD label is also shown. The exact size and location depend on the reel and packing carton type.



<span id="page-22-3"></span>**Figure 42: Location of batch label on sealed reel and packing carton, MSD label also shown**

For large quantities, products are shipped in a shipping parcel and labeled with a multipack label.

#### <span id="page-22-1"></span>**Labeling for chipset packages**

Depending on the place of production, some chipset packages are shipped with labels that include 2D bar codes, as shown i[n Figure 43.](#page-23-1)

#### **2.6.2.1 Unique reel ID definition**

In the case of product recall, rework, or other such cases, the unique reel ID on the batch label allows the tracking of the products back to the customer. For example, the unique reel ID MZ233900105 shown i[n Table 17](#page-24-0) contains the following information:

Unique reel ID = XIIIYYWWDDDDD

- X: Production site
- I: Product form factor identifier (varies in length)
- YYWW: Year and calendar week (ISO 8601)
- DDDDD: Decimal counter with weekly reset

#### <span id="page-27-0"></span>**Customer-specific labeling**

For key customers, u-blox offers customer-specific labeling on the primary packaging level.

#### **The scope of this service covers:**

- Individually designed labels according to customer requirements
- Three labels per packing carton: one on the carton, one loose in carton, and one on vacuum bag
- Label size is standardized at 14 x 9 cm

[Figure 49,](#page-27-1) [Figure 50,](#page-27-2) and [Figure 51](#page-27-3) show examples of customer-specific, labeled shipments.

#### <span id="page-28-0"></span>**2.7 Shipping of non-standard quantities**

Orders with quantities not corresponding to an exact number of a reel size or tray size may vary from the packaging description above.

Although some variation in the packaging arrangements of some products can occur, the following packaging policy generally applies:

- Product orders for volumes less than that normally delivered on full reel are accommodated by cutting-off the requested quantity from the reeled tape. The tape is then rolled up and affixed with adhesive tape before dispatching the carrier tape in a sealed bag – without the reel. A desiccant bag and a humidity indicator card are included in the bag before it is sealed, as shown i[n Figure 52.](#page-28-1)
- Trays used for product shipping are normally stacked on top of one another. For safe delivery, partially filled trays are usually covered with another empty tray. The trays are secured with ESD tape and a product label, as shown in [Figure 53.](#page-28-2) See also [Shipping parcels for trays or](#page-19-0)  [compartments.](#page-19-0)
- Very small quantities are normally packed in a cushioned envelope, as shown in [Figure 54.](#page-28-3)
- All outer packages bear the standard u-blox label also shown in [Figure 54.](#page-28-3)
- **☞** Product orders for volumes less than order quantities specified in the product data sheet or integration manual must be requested specifically in the purchase order. The number of pieces on a single reel of tape varies between products but is defined in the respective product data sheet.

### <span id="page-29-0"></span>**3 Storage and handling of chips and modules**

<span id="page-29-4"></span>u-blox chips and modules are sensitive to moisture and electrostatic charges. Carefully read the storage and handling precautions outlined in this chapter to prevent damage from moisture intake and electrostatic charges.

The moisture sensitivity level (MSL) relates to the required packaging and handling precautions for semiconductor devices, including u-blox chips and modules. The MSL for each u-blox device is defined in either the product data sheet or integration manual.

[Table 19](#page-29-5) summarizes the dry pack requirements for different MSLs in the IPC/JEDEC specification.

| MSL | Dry pack requirement |
|-----|----------------------|
| 1   | Optional             |
| 2   | Required             |
| 2a  | Required             |
| 3   | Required             |
| 4   | Required             |

<span id="page-29-5"></span>**Table 19: JEDEC specification of dry pack requirements**

According to IPC/JEDEC specification J-STD-020, if a device passes MSL 1 it is not classified as moisture sensitive and does not require dry pack. If a device fails level 1 but passes a higher numerical level, it is classified as moisture sensitive and must be dry packed in accordance with J-STD-033.

#### <span id="page-29-2"></span>**Dry packing**

u-blox ships products rated at MSL2 or above are dry-packed in a moisture barrier bag (MBB). Carrier materials such as trays, tubes, and reels that are placed in the MBB can affect the moisture level within the dry bag. A desiccant is put in the MBB to minimalize the effect of any moisture on these materials and ensure the shelf life of the SMT packages. See als[o Moisture sensitivity.](#page-5-1)

**☞** u-blox uses humidity indicator cards that are free from cobalt dichloride.

IPC/JEDEC specifications require that MSD-sensitive devices are also packaged with a Humidity Indicator Card (HIC) to measure the amount of humidity the devices have been exposed to during shipment. If no moisture has been absorbed, the three fields in the HIC indicate blue color.

**☞** Micro lead frame (MLF) and Quad-flat, no-lead (QFN) chipset packages are rated MSL=1 and do not need to be dry-packed.

#### <span id="page-31-0"></span>**Storage and floor life**

The calculated shelf life for dry-packed SMT packages is 12 months from the bag seal date when stored in a non-condensing atmospheric environment of <+40 °C/90% RH.

| MSL level | Floor life (out of bag) at factory ambient ≤30 °C/60% RH or as stated |  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--|
| 1         | Unlimited at ≤30°C/85% RH                                             |  |

[Table 20](#page-31-2) lists the floor life for different MSL levels in the IPC/JDEC specification.

#### <span id="page-31-2"></span>**Table 20: JEDEC specification of floor life**

The parts must be processed and soldered within the time specified for the MSL level. If this time is exceeded, or the humidity indicator card in the sealed package indicates that they have been exposed to moisture, the devices need to be pre-baked before the reflow solder process.

**⚠** Risk of oxidation: Baking SMT packages may cause oxidation and/or intermetallic growth of the terminations, which, if excessive, can result in solderability problems during board assembly. The temperature and baking timesSMT packages are limited by soldering constraints. The cumulative baking time at temperatures greater than +90 °C and up to +125 °C shall not exceed 96 hours. There is no limit on the bake time for temperatures less than +90 °C. Do not bake SMT packages in temperatures higher than +125 °C.

#### <span id="page-31-1"></span>**Drying**

Both encapsulated and substrate materials absorb moisture. IPC/JEDEC specification J-STD-020 must be observed to prevent cracking and delamination associated with the "popcorn effect" during reflow soldering. The popcorn effect can be described as miniature explosions of evaporating moisture. Baking before processing is required in the following cases:

- Humidity indicator card: At least one circular indicator is no longer blue.
- Floor life or environmental requirements after opening the seal have been exceeded, for example, exposure to excessive seasonal humidity.
- **☞** For the recommended baking procedures, refer to Section 4 of IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033. In addition to other recommendations, Table 4-1 of the specification also lists the required conditions for drying.

[Table 21](#page-32-2) describes the required baking times for different package thicknesses and MSL level. For example, an SMD package with a thickness between 2.0 and 4.5 mm that has exceeded its floor life by >72 hours must be baked at +125 °C for 48 hours. Floor life commences with time = 0 immediately after the bake. Package thicknesses and MSL values are specified in the product data sheet or integration manual.

<span id="page-32-2"></span>**Table 21: Bake times for SMD packages exceeding floor life by > 72 hours (see also IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033, section 4)**

- **⚠** Do not attempt to bake u-blox products while contained in tape and rolled up in reels. For baking, place parts individually onto the oven tray.
- **⚠** Risk of oxidation: Baking SMT packages may cause oxidation and/or intermetallic growth of the terminations, which, if excessive, can result in solderability problems during board assembly. The temperature and baking times SMT packages are limited by soldering constraints. The cumulative baking time at temperatures greater than +90 °C and up to +125 °C shall not exceed 96 hours. There is no limit on the bake time for temperatures less than +90 °C. Do not bake SMT packages in temperatures higher than +125 °C.

#### <span id="page-32-0"></span>**3.2 Handling**

**⚠** u-blox chips and modules are electrostatic sensitive devices (ESD) that demand the observance of special ESD precautions during any handling. Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the device.

#### <span id="page-32-1"></span>**ESD handling precautions**

Proper ESD handling and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling, and operation of any application that incorporates these products. Handling without proper ESD protection may destroy or damage them permanently. The risk of electrostatic charges makes patch antennas particularly susceptible to damage.

The absolute maximum ratings that define the stresses beyond which can cause permanent damage to the device are specified in the respective product data sheet. For recommended ESD precautions during design and implementation, see the product Hardware/System integration manual.

**⚠** Failure to observe these precautions can result in severe damage to the device!
