## <span id="page-3-1"></span>**1.1 Overview**

The ZED-F9K-00B module features the u-blox F9 multi-band L1/L2 GNSS receiver with rapid convergence time within seconds. This mass-market component provides decimeter-level positioning with high availability, while making use of all four GNSS constellations simultaneously.

It is the first dead reckoning module with an integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) capable of high precision positioning. The sophisticated built-in algorithms fuse the IMU data, GNSS measurements, wheel ticks, and vehicle dynamics model to provide lane-accurate positioning where GNSS alone would fail. The module operates under open-sky motorways, in the wooded countryside, in difficult urban environments, and even in tunnels and underground parking. In modern automotive applications, such as advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) where availability can improve the safety of our roads, ZED-F9K-00B is the ultimate solution.

The device is a turnkey solution eliminating the technical risk of integrating third-party libraries, precise positioning engines, and the multi-faceted hardware engineering aspects of radio frequency design and digital design. The u-blox approach provides a transparent evaluation of the positioning solution and clear lines of responsibility for design support while reducing supply chain complexity during production.

ZED-F9K-00B is ideal for innovative automotive architecture designs with limited space and power. The module provides accurate location services to the increasing number of intelligent electronic control units (ECU) such as telematics control unit, navigation system, infotainment and V2X safety systems.

In priority navigation mode the module reaches a navigation rate of up to 30 Hz. The on-board processor augments fused GNSS position with additional IMU-based position estimates. Drivers experience responsive, lag-free user interfaces. ZED-F9K-00B can output raw IMU and raw GNSS data for advanced applications.

ZED-F9K-00B modules are manufactured in ISO/TS 16949 certified sites and are fully tested on a system level. Qualification tests are performed as stipulated in the ISO 16750 standard: "Road vehiclesâEnvironmental conditions and testing for electrical and electronic equipment".

## <span id="page-5-0"></span>**1.3 Supported GNSS constellations**

The ZED-F9K-00B GNSSmodules are concurrent GNSSreceivers that canreceive andtrackmultiple GNSS constellations. Owing to the multi-band RF front-end architecture, all four major GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou) plus SBAS and QZSS satellites can be received concurrently. All satellites in view can be processed to provide an RTK navigation solution when used with correction data. If power consumption is a key factor, the receiver can be configured for a subset of GNSS constellations.

All satellites in view can be processed to provide an RTK navigation solution when used with correction data; the highest positioning accuracy will be achieved when the receiver is tracking signals on both bands from multiple satellites, and is provided with corresponding correction data.

The QZSS system shares the same frequency bands with GPS and can only be processed in conjunction with GPS.

To benefit from multi-band signal reception, dedicated hardware preparation must be made during the design-in phase. See the Integration manual [[1](#page-25-1)] for u-blox design recommendations.

#### <span id="page-5-2"></span>**1.4.1 Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)**

The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a regional navigation satellite system that provides positioning services for the Pacific region covering Japan and Australia. The ZED-F9K-00B is able to receive and track QZSS L1 C/A and L2C signals concurrently with GPS signals, resulting in better availability especially under challenging signal conditions, e.g. in urban canyons.



QZSS can be enabled only if GPS operation is also configured.

#### <span id="page-6-0"></span>**1.4.2 Satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS)**

The ZED-F9K-00B optionally supports SBAS (including WAAS in the US, EGNOS in Europe, MSAS in Japan and GAGAN in India) to deliver improved location accuracy within the regions covered. However, the additional inter-standard time calibration step used during SBAS reception results in degraded time accuracy overall.

SBAS reception is enabled by default in ZED-F9K-00B.

The ZED-F9K-00B can output all the GNSS broadcast data upon reception from tracked satellites. This includes all the supported GNSS signals as well as the QZSS augmentation service. The UBX-RXM-SFRBX message provides this information, see the Interface description [\[2\]](#page-25-2) for the UBX-



RXM-SFRBX message specification. The receiver can provide satellite signal information in a form compatible with the Radio Resource LCS Protocol (RRLP) [\[4\]](#page-25-3).

#### <span id="page-7-0"></span>**1.5.1 Carrier-phase measurements**

The ZED-F9K-00B modules provide raw carrier-phase data for all supported signals, along with pseudorange, Doppler and measurement quality information. The data contained in the UBX-RXM-RAWX message follows the conventions of a multi-GNSS RINEX 3 observation file. For the UBX-RXM-RAWX message specification, see Interface description [\[2\]](#page-25-2).

Raw measurement data are available once the receiver has established data bit synchronization and time-of-week.

Only available with an optional license for an additional cost.

For specification of the protocols, see the Interface description [[2](#page-25-2)].

#### <span id="page-7-2"></span>**1.7 Automotive dead reckoning**

u-blox's proprietary automotive dead reckoning (ADR) solution uses a 3D inertial measurement unit (IMU) included within the module, and speed pulses from the vehicle's wheel tick (WT) sensor. Alternatively, the vehicle speed data can be provided as messages via a serial interface. Sensor data and GNSS signals are processed together, achieving 100% coverage, with highly accurate and continuous positioning even in GNSS-hostile environments (for example in urban canyons) or in case of GNSS signal absence (for example in tunnels and parking garages).

WT or speed sensor rate variations and the 3D IMU sensors are calibrated automatically and continuously by the module, accommodating automatically for example to vehicle tire wear.

For more details, see the integration manual [\[1\]](#page-25-1).

The ZED-F9K-00B combines GNSS and dead reckoning measurements and computes a position solution at rates of up to 5 Hz with the non-priority navigation mode. In the priority navigation mode, the navigation rate can be increased using IMU-only data to deliver accurate, low-latency position measurements at rates up to 30 Hz. These solutions are reported in standard NMEA, UBX-NAV-PVT and similar messages.

The priority navigation mode works optimally when the IMU and WT sensors have been calibrated, and the alignment angles are correct.

Dead reckoning allows navigation to commence as soon as power is applied to the module (that is, before a GNSS fix has been established) under the following conditions:

- The vehicle has not been moved while the module has been switched off.
- At least a dead reckoning fix was available when the vehicle was last used.
- A backup supply has been available for the module since the vehicle was last used.



The save-on-shutdown feature can be used when no backup supply is available. All necessary information is saved to the flash and read from the flash upon restart.

# <span id="page-15-0"></span>**5 Communications interfaces**

The ZED-F9K-00B has several communications interfaces [19](#page-15-3) , including UART, SPI, I2C and USB.

All the inputs have internal pull-up resistors in normal operation and can be left open if not used. All the PIOs are supplied by VCC, therefore all the voltage levels of the PIO pins are related to VCC supply voltage.

## <span id="page-15-1"></span>**5.1 UART**

The UART interfaces support configurable baud rates. See the Integration manual [\[1\]](#page-25-1).

Hardware flow control is not supported.

UART1 is the primary host communications interface while UART2 is dedicated for RTCM 3.3 corrections and NMEA. No UBX protocol is supported on UART 2.

The UART1 is enabled if D\_SEL pin of the module is left open or "high".

**Table 11: ZED-F9K-00B UART specifications**

## <span id="page-15-2"></span>**5.2 SPI**

The SPI interface is disabled by default. The SPI interface shares pins with UART and I2C and can be selected by setting D\_SEL = 0. The SPI interface can be operated in peripheral mode only. The maximum transfer rate using SPI is 125 kB/s and the maximum SPI clock frequency is 5.5 MHz.

The SPI timing parameters for peripheral operation are defined in [Figure](#page-16-0) 3. Default SPI configuration is CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 0.

### <span id="page-17-0"></span>**5.3 I2C**

An I2C interface is available for communication with an external host CPU in I2C Fast-mode. Backwards compatibility with Standard-mode I2C bus operation is not supported. The interface can be operated only in peripheral mode with a maximum bit rate of 400 kbit/s. The interface can make use of clock stretching by holding the SCL line LOW to pause a transaction. In this case, the bit transfer rate is reduced. The maximum clock stretching time is 20 ms.

The I2C interface is only available with the UART default mode. If the SPI interface is selected by using D\_SEL = 0, the I2C interface is not available.

#### <span id="page-18-0"></span>**5.4 USB**

The USB 2.0 FS (full speed, 12 Mbit/s) interface can be used for host communication. Due to the hardware implementation, it may not be possible to certify the USB interface. The V\_USB pin supplies the USB interface.

### <span id="page-18-1"></span>**5.5 WT (wheel tick) and DIR (forward/reverse indication)**

ZED-F9K-00B pin 22(WT)is available as awheel-tick input.Thepin23(DIR)is available as adirection input (forward/reverse indication).

By default the wheel tick count is derived from the rising edges of the WT input.

For optimal performance the wheel tick resolution should be less than 5 cm. With the maximum supported wheel tick resolution is 40 cm.

The DIR input shall indicate whether the vehicle is moving forwards or backwards.

Alternatively, the vehicleWT(or speed) and DIR inputs can be provided via one of the communication interfaces with UBX-ESF-MEAS messages.

For more details, see the integration manual [\[1\]](#page-25-1).

<span id="page-18-2"></span><sup>20</sup> External device must provide a hold time of at least one transition time (max 300 ns) for the SDA signal (with respect to the min Vih of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.

<span id="page-18-3"></span><sup>21</sup> The maximum tHD;DAT must be less than the maximum tVD;DAT or tVD;ACK with a maximum of 0.9 Âµs by a transition time. This maximum must only be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (tLOW) of the SCL signal. If the clock stretches the SCL, the data must be valid by the set-up time before it releases the clock.

<span id="page-18-4"></span><sup>22</sup> When the I2C peripheral is stretching the clock, the tSU;DAT of the first bit of the next byte is 62.5 ns.

By default, the ZED-F9K-00B outputs NMEA messages that include satellite data for all GNSS bands being received. This results in a high NMEA output load for each navigation period. Make sure the UART baud rate used is sufficient for the selected navigation rate and the number of GNSS signals being received.
