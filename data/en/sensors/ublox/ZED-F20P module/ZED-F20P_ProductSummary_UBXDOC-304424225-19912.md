### **Product description**

The ZED-F20P module delivers robust high-precision GNSS performance for fast-scaling robotics applications on the ground and in the air. With support for triple-band GNSS (L1/ L2/L5) and advanced positioning techniques, including RTK and PPP-RTK, it enables centimeter-level accuracy with fast convergence and highest reliability — ideal for autonomous systems operating in dynamic, real-world conditions.

Optimized for the needs of robotic lawn mowers, unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), and other industrial automation platforms, ZED-F20P balances high performance with power efficiency in a compact, integration-friendly design. It concurrently receives signals from GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, and NavIC across three frequency bands, ensuring resilient positioning even in GNSS-challenged environments. ZED-F20P supports RTCM and SPARTN correction formats, enabling flexibility across local and cloud-based correction sources, including Virtual Reference Stations (VRS) and

continental-wide SSR services. Its fast update rate, minimal cycle slips, and low-noise measurements make it ideal for precise control loops and smooth path execution.

Designed to accelerate time-to-market for innovative robotic platforms, ZED-F20P includes key security features, including OSNMA-based message authentication, providing both accuracy and integrity in safety-critical systems.

ZED-F20P is your GNSS foundation for the next generation of scalable robotic applications.
