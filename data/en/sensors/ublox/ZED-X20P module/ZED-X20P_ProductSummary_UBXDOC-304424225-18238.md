### **Product description**

The ZED-X20P module sets the standard in positioning performance and features for mass markets to protect your investments. It integrates all-band GNSS with signal modernization and innovative positioning algorithms using Real-time Kinematics (RTK), PPP-RTK, and Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technologies in a compact, energy-effi cient form factor. As the most reliable position sensor from the most trusted name in GNSS, ZED-X20P ensures unparalleled reliability and performance.

ZED-X20P concurrently processes signals from the GPS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, and NavIC constellations across all GNSS bands, including L-band. The highest level of integration on a single-chip receiver enables new system architectures and creates value for industrial navigation and robotics markets in products such as unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs), guidance systems, and autosteering applications.

With its very high update rate, the ZED-X20P module is ideal for control applications, ensuring smooth and reliable operation. For advanced users, its pristine raw data features minimal cycle slips and exceptionally low noise in carrier range and pseudo-range measurements. ZED-X20P protects system integrity with multi-layered defenses, including a Root of Trust, jamming and spoofi ng detection, cryptographic authentication of navigation messages through Galileo OSNMA, and more. High-value, application-specifi c features such as moving baseline are also available.

The receiver enables easy integration, helping product developers bring their ideas to market quickly. ZED-X20P off ers support for a range of correction services natively, striking the perfect balance between performance and data usage. It supports standard RTCM corrections for Virtual Reference Stations (VRS) in a Network RTK setup or a local base station setup. SPARTN-format SSR correction service broadcasts are also supported for mass-market applications, and direct reception of PPP global services simplifi es deployments.
